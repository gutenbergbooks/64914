<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">There</span> is a charm and compelling fascination about Seville which produces
in the traveller visiting the city for the first time a sensation of
physical ecstasy. The spell of the Pearl of Andalusia is instant and
enduring; I have not met a man or woman proof against its witchery.
George Borrow shed tears of rapture as he beheld Seville from the
Cristina Promenade, and “listened to the thrush and the nightingale
piping forth their melodious songs in the woods, and inhaled the breeze
laden with the perfume of its thousand orange gardens.” The Moors left
their beloved capital at the height of its prosperity, in the full
flower of its beauty; change has not affected its material importance,
and time has not staled its infinite variety. A Christian Cathedral now
stands on the foundation of the great mosque of Abu Yakub Yusuf; but the
Moorish Giralda, the most expressive monument of the Mohammedan
occupation, still beckons the distant traveller onwards to the promised
land; the Alcazar breathes the spirit of its Oriental masters; and the
shim<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vi" id="page_vi">{vi}</a></span>mering Torre del Oro still reflects the light of the setting sun
upon the broad bosom of the rose-coloured river.</p>

<p>The history of Seville from the time of its subjugation by Musa is a
volume of romance; its pages are illumined by the cold light of flashing
steel and stained with the blood of tyrants, traitors, and innocent men;
but it forms a chronicle which the reader will follow with absorbing
interest. The more exacting student will satisfy his thirst for
knowledge in Dr Dozy’s “History of the Mohammedans of Spain,” in
Gayangos’ translation of El Makkari’s “History of the Mohammedan
Dynasties in Spain,” in Coppee’s “History of the Conquest of Spain,” and
Pedro de Madrazo’s “Sevilla”&mdash;to refer to only a few of the many learned
works that have been published on the subject. Many will continue to be
content with the few pages of Notes which appear in the various Spanish
Guides; but a certain section, it is hoped, of the English travelling
public, will find in this book an album, a handbook, and a history which
will supply a long-felt want.</p>

<p>In my attempt to produce a volume which will appeal both to the artist
and the tourist, to the archæologist as well as the least imaginative
sightseer, I have reproduced a number of illustrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_vii" id="page_vii">{vii}</a></span> which may
incline some persons to accuse me of a superabundant regard for detail.
It is true that many pages are devoted to intricacies of decoration
which the general reader may find of small interest, but my object in
multiplying this detail is to satisfy the requirements of those who
would fathom the mystery of Moslem art. When I was first in Granada I
inquired for pictures of the minutiæ of many choice examples of design,
and, failing to obtain anything of the kind, I had to employ a local
artist to make sketches of the detail of the mosaics. That experience
determined me, in treating of these Mohammedan cities of Spain, to
include those reproductions for which I had searched in vain, and to
make my illustrations, as far as possible, the last word on the subject
of Arabian architecture and ornament.</p>

<p>For the historical portion of the letterpress I have laid under tribute
the authorities already mentioned, and I have also to acknowledge the
assistance received in the compilation from Mr E. B. d’Auvergne.</p>

<p>A large number of the photographs included here were supplied by Messrs
Rafael Garzon and Senan &amp; Gonzalez of Granada, Hauser &amp; Menet of Madrid,
Ernst Wasmuth of Berlin, publisher of Uhde’s “Baudenkmaeler in Spanien
und Portugal,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_viii" id="page_viii">{viii}</a></span> and Eugen Twietmayer of Leipzig, publisher of
Junghandel’s “Die Baukunst Spaniens,” and my thanks are due to them for
the courteous permission to reproduce their work in this volume.</p>

<p>Some of the illustrations are reproductions of pictures which were at
one time in the San Telmo Collection. As that collection has been
distributed I have been unable to trace the originals, but as they were
so closely identified with Seville I make no apology for including them.</p>

<h2><a name="SEVILLE" id="SEVILLE"></a>SEVILLE</h2>


<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Seville</span> is the most Spanish of the cities of Spain. On her white walls
the sunlight plays perpetually, the air is laden with the scent of the
orange, the sound of the guitar and castanets is heard continually in
the narrow streets. This is the South of romance, the South of which
northerners dream and towards which so many of them are drawn by an
irresistible fascination. The cities of Leon and Castile are grim and
Gothic. Cordova is Moorish; but Seville is not essentially one nor the
other, but presents that blending of both styles which makes her
typical, which stands for all that Spain means to the average foreigner.</p>

<p>Seville lives. Cordova is dead, and Granada broods over her past. These
are cemeteries of a vanished civilisation. Alone among the ancient seats
of Moorish dominion, Seville has maintained her prosperity. Her wharves,
as in the days of Al Mansûr, are still the resort of sailors from many
lands. There is still wealth in her palaces and genius in her schools.
To-day she holds the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_2" id="page_2">{2}</a></span> place in native art, and Garcia y Ramos,
Sanchez Perrier, Jimenez Aranda, and Bilbao not unworthily continue the
traditions of Murillo and Zurbarán.</p>

<p>The city is Moorish, but informed throughout with the spirit of Spain.
In Cordova the Spaniard seems a stranger; in Seville he has assimilated
and adapted all that was bequeathed by his onetime rulers till you might
think the place had always been his. It is as though the glowing metal
of Andalusian life and temper had been poured into a mould made
expressly by other hands to receive it. Thus Seville has not died nor
decayed like her rivals. Her vitality intoxicates the northerner. Valdés
says, “Seville has ever been for me the symbol of light, the city of
love and joy.”</p>

<p>In my book, “Moorish Remains in Spain,” I have sketched the history of
the city and briefly referred to its importance under the Roman sway.
With the few monuments remaining from that time I do not purpose dealing
separately&mdash;incorporated as they have been, for the most part, with
works of more recent construction. Nor has Roman influence left very
profound traces in Seville, any more than in the rest of Spain. Señor
Rafael Contreras justly remarks that Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span> civilisation made no deep
impression on the country or the people. “We have in Spain,” he
continues, “aqueducts, bridges, circuses, baths, roads, vases, urns,
milliaria, statues, and jewellery. Specimens are still found, but,
strictly speaking, art with us has never been either Roman or Greek.”
And Seville, in particular, even during the Roman occupation, was rather
a Punic than a Latin town. As to the successors of the Cæsars&mdash;the
Visigoths&mdash;to them can only be ascribed a few capitals and stone
ornaments, roughly executed in the Byzantine style. These, like the
Roman remains, were used by the Moors in the construction of those
buildings that have determined the physiognomy of Seville.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="MOORISH_SEVILLE" id="MOORISH_SEVILLE"></a>MOORISH SEVILLE</h2>


<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Seville</span> was not among the spoils of Tarik, conqueror at the Guadalete.
That general having directed his march upon Toledo, it was reserved to
his superior officer, Musa Ben Nosseyr, to subdue the proudest city of
Bætica. The citizens held out for a month and then retired upon Beja in
Alemtejo. The Arabian commander left a garrison in the city,
henceforward to be known for five hundred and thirty-six years as
Ishbiliyah, and pushed forward to Merida. The Sevillians took advantage
of his absence to shake off his yoke, assisted by the people of Beja and
Niebla. Their triumph was short lived. Abdelasis, son of Musa, fell upon
them like a thunderbolt, extinguished the rising in blood, and made the
city the seat of government of the newly acquired provinces.</p>

<p>The interesting personality and tragic fate of Seville’s first Viceroy
have made the site of his residence a question of some importance. It
was formerly believed that he occupied the Acropolis<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span> or Citadel,
supposed then to be covered by the Alcazar. The researches of Señores
Gayangos and Madrazo have made it plain, however, that he established
his headquarters in a church which had been dedicated by the sister of
St Isidore to the martyrs Rufina and Justa, now amalgamated with the
convent of La Trinidad. Adjacent to this building Abdelasis erected a
mosque; and it was within its walls, while reciting the first surah of
the Koran, that he was assassinated by the emissaries of the Khalif of
Damascus&mdash;death being a not uncommon reward in the Middle Ages for too
brilliant military services rendered to one’s sovereign.</p>

<p>The seat of government was transferred, soon after the murder of the son
of Musa, to Cordova, and Seville sank for a time to a subsidiary rank.
The various cities of Andalusia were allotted by the governor Abdelmelic
among the different Syrian peoples who had flocked over on the news of
the conquest; and Ishbiliyah, according to Señor de Madrazo, was
assigned to the citizens of Horns, the classic Emesa. Owing to
intermarriage between the conquerors and the natives, the distinction
between the Moslems according to the places of origin of these early
settlers was soon lost in that drawn between the pure-blooded Arabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span> and
the Muwallads or half-breeds. In the meantime the germs of Arabian
culture had fallen upon a kindly soil, and a new school of art and
letters was in process of formation in Spain. The imposing monuments of
Roman, Greek, and Byzantine civilisation, which the victorious hosts of
Islam found ever in their path, were not without influence upon their
conceptions of the beautiful in form. The fusion of the Hispano-Goths
and Arabs likewise tended to produce a commingling of spirit, and
ultimately to give birth to an art and a culture racy of the soil.
“According to all contemporary writers,” says Señor Rafael Contreras,
“it is beyond all doubt that the style which the artists of the
Renaissance called Moorish (in the sense of originating in Northern
Africa) was never anything of the sort. The details so much admired on
account of their richness, the vaultings and the arched hollows
practised in the walls, the festoons of the arches, the <i>commarajias</i>
and <i>alicates</i>, were Spanish works finer and more delicate than those of
the East. The root was originally in Arabia, but it was happily
transplanted to Spain, where blossomed that beautiful flower which
diffuses its perfume after a lapse of seven centuries.”</p>

<p>Under the Western Khalifate, Seville flourished<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span> in spite of the
assaults and internecine warfare of which it was frequently the theatre.
When in 888 Andalusia became temporarily split up into several nominally
independent states, the city acknowledged the sway of Ibrahim Ibn
Hajjaj. The chronicler Ben Hayán, often quoted by Señor de Madrazo,
describes this prince as keeping up imperial state and riding forth
attended by five hundred horsemen. He ventured to assume the <i>tiraz</i>,
the official garb of the Amirs of Cordova. To his court flocked the
poets, the singers, and the wise men of Islam. Of him it was written,
“In all the West I find no right noble man save Ibrahim, but he is
nobility itself. When one has known the delight of living with him, to
dwell in any other land is misery.” Flattery did not blind the sagacious
Ibn Hajjaj to the insecurity of his position, and he bowed before the
rising star of the new Khalifa, Abd-er-Rahman III. In 913 Ishbiliyah
opened her gates to that powerful ruler and again became subject to
Cordova. The city lost nothing by its timely submission. The generous
and beneficent Khalifa narrowed and deepened the channel of the
Guadalquivir, thus rendering it navigable. He introduced the palm tree
from Africa, planted gardens, and adorned the city with splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span>
edifices. Much of the splendour of the Court of Cordova was reflected on
Seville, which certainly rivalled the capital as a seat of learning.
Among its citizens was Abu Omar Ahmed Ben Abdallah, surnamed <i>El Begi</i>
or “the Sage,” the author of an encyclopædia of sciences, which was long
esteemed as a work of marvellous erudition. According to Condé, Abdallah
was frequently consulted by the magistrates, even in his early youth, in
affairs of the gravest import.</p>

<p>The public edifices of the Pearl of Andalusia were no doubt worthy of
its fame as a home of wisdom and culture. In addition to the mosque
built by Abdelasis, near or on the spot where the convent of La Trinidad
now stands, a notable ornament of the city was the mosque raised on the
site of the basilica of St Vincent&mdash;immortalised by several memorable
Councils. “But who,” asks Señor de Madrazo, “would be capable to-day of
describing this edifice? Nothing of it remains except the memory of the
place where it stood. Other structures, ampler and more majestic,
replaced it when, under the Almoravides and Almohades, Seville recovered
its rank as an independent kingdom. Let us content ourselves with
recording that the principal mosque, built at the same time as and on
the model of that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span> Cordova, although on a smaller and less sumptuous
scale, was situated on the site of the existing Cathedral, and that in
the ninth century it was burnt by the Normans. In consequence it is
impossible to say if the great horseshoe arches which occur in the
cloister of the Cathedral are works earlier or later than that event. It
does not appear probable that in the time of the Khalifs the mosque of
Seville could have had the considerable dimensions suggested by the
northern boundary of the <i>patio de los naranjos</i>. That line is 330
Castilian feet, which would give the mosque, extending from north to
south, a length about double, the breadth of the atrium
included&mdash;unlikely dimensions for a temple which, compared with the Jama
of Cordova, was unquestionably of the second class. No one knows who
ordered the construction of the primitive mosque of Seville.”</p>

<p>The irruption of the Normans, one of the results of which was the
demolition of this edifice, took place in 859. The pirates were
afterwards defeated off the coast of Murcia by the Moorish squadron, and
made sail for Catalonia. A serious descent had taken place in 844.
Lisbon was the first city to fall a victim to the Northmen, whom we next
hear of at Cadiz and at Sidonia, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span> they defeated the Khalifa’s
troops in a pitched battle. Fierce fighting took place before the walls
of Ishbiliyah, the invaders being uniformly victorious. Laden with the
richest booty, they at length retired overland to Lisbon, where they
took to their ships. They not only destroyed the mosque of Seville, but
threw down the city walls, which dated from Roman times. These were
repaired by Abd-er-Rahman II., to be partially demolished again by
Abd-er-Rahman III. on his triumphal entry into the amirate of Ibrahim
Ibn Hajjaj.</p>

<p>The subjection of Seville to the yoke of the Khalifs of Cordova was,
unhappily for the city and for Islam generally, not of long duration.
The mighty Wizir, Al Mansûr, restored the waning power of the Crescent
and drove back the Christians into the mountain fastnesses of the North.
But the collapse of the Western Khalifate had been postponed, not
averted. This Al Mansûr well knew. On his deathbed he reproached his son
for yielding to unmanly tears, saying, “This is to me a signal of the
approaching decay of this empire.” His prediction did not long await
fulfilment. In 1009, seven years after his death, his second son,
Abd-er-Rahman Sanjul, had the audacity to proclaim himself the Khalif
Hisha<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span>m’s heir. The empire became at once resolved into its component
parts. On all sides the kadis and governors revolted. Independent
amirates were set up in all the considerable towns. At Ishbiliyah the
shrewd and powerful kadi, Mohammed Ben Abbad, perceived his opportunity,
but contrived to excuse his ambition by a specious pretence of legality.
An impostor, impersonating the legitimate Khalifa, Hisham, appeared on
the troubled scene. Ben Abbad espoused his cause and pretended to govern
the city in his name. His power firmly established, the kadi announced
that the Khalifa was dead and had designated him as his lawful
successor. For the second time, Seville rose to the dignity of an
independent state.</p>

<p>The Abbadites were a splendour-loving race. Their Court was extolled by
Arabian writers as rivalling that of the Abbasside sultans. Under their
rule the city waxed every year more beautiful, more prosperous. Patrons
of art and letters, the amirs were vigorous and capable sovereigns, and
in all Musulman Spain no state was more powerful than theirs, except
Toledo. The second monarch of the dynasty, Abu Amru Abbad, better known
as Mo’temid, was a mighty warrior. He reduced Algarve and took Cordova.
When not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span> engaged in martial exploits he took delight in composing
verses, in the society of talented men, and in the contemplation of the
garden of his enemies’ heads, which he had laid out at the door of his
palace. He was succeeded in 1069 by his son Abul-Kasim Mohammed, a
native of Beja.</p>

<p>The Crescent was waning. All Al Mansûr’s conquests had been recovered by
the Christians. Toledo fell before the arms of Alfonso III. The
Castilians overran Portugal and penetrated into Andalusia. The Amir of
Ishbiliyah took the only course open to him at the moment, and
cultivated the friendship of the Castilian king. He consented to the
removal of the body of St Isidore from Italica to Leon, and gave his
daughter Zayda in a sort of left-handed marriage to Alfonso III. As the
Christian king was already the husband of Queen Constancia, and Zayda’s
dowry consisted of the most valuable conquests of the Amir Mut’adid,
this transaction did not reflect much credit on either party. But it
purchased for Seville a period of peace and security, during which its
inhabitants became hopelessly enervated by luxury and ease.</p>

<p>The Abbadite sovereigns have left but few traces on the city which they
did so much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span> embellish and improve. To them, however, may be ascribed
the foundation of the Alcazar. Such at least is the opinion of Señor de
Madrazo. In the horseshoe arches of the Salón de los Embajadores with
their rich Corinthian capitals&mdash;on which the names of different Khalifas
are inscribed&mdash;we detect a resemblance to the mosque of Cordova, and
recognise the early Saracenic style, unaffected by African, or properly
Moorish, influence. To the same period and school of architecture, Señor
de Madrazo attributes the ornate arcading of the narrow staircase
leading from the entrance court to near the balcony of the chapel; and
the three arches with capitals in the abandoned apartment adjoining the
Salón de los Principes. The ultra-semicircular curve of the arch occurs
very rarely in later or true Moorish architecture.</p>

<p>The Moslem conquerors had, in the majority of cases, converted to their
use the Christian churches in the cities they occupied. Many of the
mosques that adorned Ishbiliyah during the reign of the race of Abbad
had been adapted in this way, the lines of pillars being readjusted in
most cases to give the structure that south-easterly direction that the
law of Islam required. Traces of these Abbadite mosques remain in the
churches of San<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span> Juan Bautista and San Salvador. On the wall of the
former was found an inscription which has been thus translated by Don
Pascual de Gayangos: “In the name of the clement and merciful Allah. May
the blessing of Allah be on Mohammed, the seal of the Prophets. The
Princess and august mother of Er-Rashid Abu-l-hosaya Obayd’ allah, son
of Mut’amid Abu-l-Kasim Mohammed Ben Abbad (may Allah make his empire
and power lasting, as well as the glory of both!), ordered this minaret
to be raised in her mosque (which may Allah preserve!), awaiting the
abundance of His rewards; and the work was finished, with the help of
Allah, by the hand of the Wizir and Katib, the Amir Abu-l-Kasim Ben
Battah (may Allah be propitious to me!), in the moon of Shaaban, in the
year 478.”</p>

<p>The site of the present collegiate church of San Salvador was occupied
by a mosque, which was used by the Moors for a considerable time after
the Christian conquest, and preserved its form down to the year 1669. An
inscription on white marble relates that a minaret was constructed in
the year 1080, by Mut’amid Ben Abbad, that “the calling to prayer might
not be interrupted.”</p>

<p>The reign of the Abbadites was brought to a close by the advent of the
Almoravides (a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span> allied to <i>Marabut</i>), who, at the invitation of the
Andalusian amirs, invaded Spain in the last quarter of the eleventh
century. It was a story common enough in history. The Africans came at
first as the friends and allies of the Spanish Arabs, and effectually
stemmed the tide of Christian successes; but in 1091, Yusuf, the
Almoravide leader, annexed Ishbiliyah and all Andalusia to his vast
empire. The city became a mere provincial centre, the appanage of the
Berber monarch. Mo’temid, loaded with chains, was transported to Africa,
where he died in 1095, having reigned as amir twenty-seven years.</p>

<p>The Almoravides lived by the sword and perished by the sword.
Perpetually engaged in warfare, among themselves or with the Christians,
they left no deep impress on the character of Seville or of Andalusia
generally. With them the student of the arts in Spain has little
concern. They burst like a tornado over the land, destroying much,
creating nothing. Little more than half-a-century had passed since the
downfall of the Abbadites, when the star of the Almoravides paled before
the rising crescent of the Almohades or Al Muwahedun. The new sectaries,
as fierce as their predecessors, but more indomitable and austere,
wrested all Barbary from the descendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_17" id="page_17">{17}</a></span> of Tashrin and annexed
Ishbiliyah to their empire in 1146.</p>

<p>The reign of the Almohades is the most interesting period in the history
of the city. It was marked by the foundation of Seville’s most important
existing edifices, and by the introduction of a new style of
architecture. Hitherto, what is loosely called Moorish art, had been
native Andalusian art, following Saracenic or Syrian ideals. Of this
first period, the Mezquita at Cordova is the finest monument. Seville is
peculiarly the city of the second, or true, Moorish period. Byzantine
and Oriental influences disappeared and were supplanted by the African
or, more properly, Berber, character. The new conquerors of Andalusia
were a rude, hardy race, and we find something virile and coarse in
their architecture. “Beside the Giralda of Seville,” remarks Herr Karl
Eugen Schmidt, “the columns of the mosque of Cordova seem small; the
pretty halls of the Alhambra have something weak and feminine.” The
weakness of the Almohade builders, as is usually the case with
imperfectly civilised peoples, lay in an excessive fondness for
ornamentation. Señor de Madrazo’s criticism, though severe, is, on the
whole, just. While admitting the beauty of certain of their innovations,
such as the stalac<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_18" id="page_18">{18}</a></span>tited dome (afterwards carried out with so much
effect at Granada) and the pointed arch, he goes on to say, “The
Almohade architecture displays that debased taste which is imitative
rather than instinctive, and which creates only by exaggerating forms to
a degree inconsistent with the design&mdash;differing from the Mudejar work
of the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, which reveals an
instinctive feeling for the beautiful in ornament, which never loses
sight of the graceful, the elegant, and the bold, and which consequently
never betrays any aberration. The Almohade style, in short, at once
manifests the vigour of the barbarian civilised by conquest; the Mudejar
style has the enduring character of the works of a man of taste, wise in
good and evil fortune; both are the faithful expression of the culture
of peoples of different origins and aptitudes.” Elsewhere the same
authority observes, “It is certain that the innovation characteristic of
Musulman architecture in Spain in the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
cannot be explained as a natural mutation from the Arabic art of the
Khalifate, or as a prelude to the art of Granada, because there is very
little similarity between the style called secondary or Moorish and the
Arab-Byzantine and Andalusian; while, on the other hand, it is evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_19" id="page_19">{19}</a></span>
that the Saracenic monuments of Fez and Morocco, of the reigns of Yusuf
Ben Tashfin, Abdul Ben Ali, Al Mansûr, and Nasr, partake of the
character of the ornamentation introduced by the Almohades into Spain.”</p>

<p>The most important example of this style is the Giralda, now adjacent to
the magnificent Christian cathedral which was reared in later days on
the foundations of the great mosque. Señor de Madrazo has reconstructed
for us the general form and aspect of the finest monument of Almohade
piety. The mosque replaced that which had been destroyed by the Normans,
and appears to have embodied some part of the original structure, to
judge from the horseshoe arches still to be seen in the Claustro de la
Granada. The work was begun by order of Yusuf, the son of Abd-er-Rahman,
the founder of the dynasty. The mosque formed a rectangle, extending
from north to south, and surrounded by cloisters and courtyards. The
interior was divided into longitudinal naves by a series of marble
columns, which supported an adorned ceiling of carved and painted wood.
The <i>mihrab</i>, or sanctuary, would have been at the southern extremity,
after the Syrian custom, it taking the Spanish Muslims some time to
realise that Mecca lay east rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_20" id="page_20">{20}</a></span> south of Andalusia. The mosque
would also have contained a <i>maksurrah</i>, or vestibule, for the imam and
his officials, the <i>nimbar</i>, or pulpit, for the sovereign, and the
tribune for the preacher. In the northern court was the existing
fountain for ablutions, surmounted by a cupola, and surrounded by orange
and palm-trees. The eastern court was known as the Court of the Elms. In
all probability, attached to the sacred edifice, was the <i>turbeh</i>, or
tomb of the founder.</p>

<p>The Giralda is not only the most important and famous of minarets, but
is among the three or four most remarkable towers in the world. It is
more to Seville than Giotto’s campanile to Florence; it rivals in fame
the now vanished campanile of St Mark’s. Unlike similar edifices in
Egypt and Syria, minarets among the western Moslems were built strong
and massive, rather than slender and elegant. The Giralda,” says Herr
Schmidt, “is one of the strongest buildings in the world, and few of our
Christian church towers could have withstood so successfully the
lightning and the earthquake.”</p>

<p>The Giralda is quadrangular in section, and covers a space of 13.60
square metres. The architect&mdash;whose name is variously spelt Gever,
Hever, and Djabir&mdash;is said to have used quantities of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_21" id="page_21">{21}</a></span> remains and
statuary as a base for the foundations. The thickness of the wall at the
base is nine feet, but it increases with the height, the interior space
narrowing accordingly. The lower part of the tower is of stone, the
upper part of brick. At a height of about 15 metres above the ground
begin those decorations in stone which lend such elegance and beauty to
this stout structure. They consist in vertical series of windows&mdash;mostly
<i>ajimeces</i> or twin-windows&mdash;some with the horseshoe, others the pointed
arch, flanked on either side by broad vertical bands of beautiful stone
tracery, resembling trellis-work. The windows are enclosed in arches
which exhibit considerable diversity of design. The decoration as a
whole is harmonious and beautiful.</p>

<p>The Moorish tower only reaches to a height of 70 metres. The remaining
portion, reaching upwards for another 25 metres, is of Christian
workmanship. Before this was added, the tower appears to have been
crowned, like most West African minarets, by a small pinnacle or turret.
This supported four balls or apples of gilded copper, one of which was
so large that the gates of Seville had to be widened that it might be
brought into the city. The iron bar which supported the balls weighed
about ten hundredweights, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_22" id="page_22">{22}</a></span> the whole was cast by a Sicilian Arab
named Abu Leyth, at a cost of £50,000 sterling. We owe these particulars
to a Mohammedan writer of the period, and his accuracy was confirmed in
1395, when the balls, having been thrown to the ground by an earthquake,
were carefully weighed and examined.</p>

<p>The upper or newer part of the Giralda was built by Fernando Ruiz in
1568. Despite its Doric and Ionic columns and Renaissance style, it does
not mar the beauty and harmony of the whole building, and is itself a
remarkably graceful work. The entablature of the second stage or storey
bears the words <i>Turris fortissima Nomen Domini</i>. The whole fabric is
surmounted by the bronze statue of Faith, executed by Bartolomé Morel in
1568. It stands fourteen feet high, and weighs twenty-five
hundredweights, yet so wonderful is the workmanship that it turns with
every breath of the wind. Hence the name applied to the whole
tower&mdash;Giralda&mdash;from <i>que gira</i>, “which turns.” The figure wears a Roman
helmet. The right hand clasps the labarum of Constantine, and the left a
palm branch symbolical of victory.</p>

<p>The Giralda is ascended by means of thirty-five inclined planes, up
which a horse might be ridden with ease to the very top. The various<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_23" id="page_23">{23}</a></span>
<i>cuerpos</i> or stages of the ascent are all named. The Cuerpo de Campanas
is named after its fine peal of bells. The bell named Santa Maria was
hung in 1588 by order of the Archbishop Gonzalo de Mena. It cost ten
thousand ducats, and weighs eighteen tons. The Cuerpo de Azucenas (or of
the lilies) is so named after its urns with floral decorations in
ironwork. El Cuerpo del Reloj (clock tower) contains a clock partly
constructed in 1765 by the monk José Cordero, with pieces of another
placed here in 1400 in the presence of Don Enrique III.&mdash;the first
tower-clock set up in Spain. The Cuerpos de Estrellas (stars) and de las
Corambolas (billiard-balls) are named after the predominant devices in
their schemes of decoration.</p>

<p>The highest platform of the Giralda affords, as might be expected, a
very extensive view. On the whole, the prospect is disappointing. The
neighbourhood of Seville is not beautiful, nor are there any very
notable sites or natural features included within the panorama. Standing
below Morel’s great statue, however, and gazing down upon the city,
interesting considerations naturally present themselves. That the figure
of Christian faith should thus be reared on the summit of a building
specially intended to stimu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_24" id="page_24">{24}</a></span>late the zeal and to excite the devotion of
the followers of Islam is a reflection calculated to give profound
satisfaction to the devout Spaniard. The whimsical philosopher may also
find an appropriateness in the handiwork of the men of the simpler,
cruder faith conducting one upwards to the more refined and complicated
creed. I do not know if Mohammedans ever visit Seville. If so, they
doubtless console themselves for the desecration of their sacred
edifices by thoughts of Hagia Sophia and the onetime Christian churches
of the East. And the Giralda has fared better at the hands of the
Christians than many a church of their own has done. I may instance the
chapel at Mayence, which with practically no alteration in its
architecture and internal arrangements now serves the purpose of a
beer-shop.</p>

<p>As the Giralda attests the size and beauty of the great mosque, so
several smaller towers exist in Seville to mark the sites of the lesser
Mohammedan temples. The most important of these is the tower or minaret
of San Marcos. It is seventy-five feet high and ten feet broad&mdash;the
highest edifice in the city except the Giralda. It is built according to
the pure Almohade style, “without any admixture,” points out Señor de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_25" id="page_25">{25}</a></span>
Madrazo, “of the features taken from the Christian architecture of the
West.” According to Mr Walter M. Gallichan there is a tradition that
Cervantes used to ascend this tower to scan the vicinity in search of a
Sevillian beauty of whom he was enamoured. The church is Gothic, and
dates from 1478, but the beautiful portal exhibits Mudejar workmanship,
and may be ascribed to the days of St Ferdinand or of his immediate
successors.</p>

<p>The parish churches of San Juan Bautista, Santa Marina, San Esteban,
Santiago, Santa Catalina, San Julián, San Ildefonso, San Andrés, San
Vicente, San Lorenzo, San Bartolomé, Santa Cruz, and Santa Maria de las
Nieves (some of which no longer exist), were all mosques during the
Almohade era. A few continue to preserve their minarets and <i>mihrabs</i>,
generally restored and modified almost beyond recognition.</p>

<p>While attending by the construction of these numerous places of worship
to the spiritual needs of their subjects, the Almohade rulers neglected
no means of strengthening Ishbiliyah and of promoting its general
prosperity. The city became the most important seat of Mohammedan power
in the West. Trade rapidly increased, and the town became the principal
resort of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_26" id="page_26">{26}</a></span> weavers, metal-workers, and other prominent Moorish
craftsmen. Abu Yakub Yusuf was the first to throw a bridge of boats
across the Guadalquivir, over which troops first passed on October 11th,
1171. This bridge immensely added to the strength of the city as a
fortified place, as it established permanent communication between it
and its principal source of supplies, the fertile district called the
Ajarafa on the right bank of the river. The charms of this expanse,
otherwise known as the Orchard of Hercules, are rapturously described by
Arab historians. These are the words of the poet Ibn Saffar: “The
Ajarafa surpasseth in beauty and fertility all the lands of the world.
The oil of its olives goeth even to far Alexandria; its farms and
orchards exceed those of other countries in size and convenience; so
white and clean are they, that they appear like so many stars in a sky
of olive gardens.” The Ajarafa is an Arabia Felix without wild beasts,
the Guadalquivir a Nile without crocodiles. El Makkari says it measured
about forty miles in each direction and contained a numerous population.
Those who know the rather dreary country extending westward of the
modern city will realise the melancholy change brought about by time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_27" id="page_27">{27}</a></span></p>

<p>The city then, as now, was girdled by strong walls. The gates were
twelve in number. Those not turned towards the river were strongly
fortified with towers and bastions. The farther bank of the Guadalquivir
was defended by castles and redoubts. Upwards of a hundred keeps and
watch-towers studded the adjacent country.</p>

<p>One of the most vital points in the defensive works was the
poetically-named Torre del Oro (tower of gold), which still exists, and
is familiar to every visitor to the city. The tower is a twelve-sided
polygon of three storeys. It is surmounted by a smaller tower, also of
twelve sides, which in turn supports a small round cupola. This
superstructure was added in the eighteenth century, whereas the main
building was erected by the Almohade governor Abu-l-Ala in the year
1220. The tower was in those days connected with the walls of the city
by what is called in military parlance a curtain, which was pulled down
as late as in 1821. The outwork faced another watch-tower on the
opposite bank of the river, and a great iron chain was drawn from the
one to the other, effectually closing the harbour against hostile
vessels. The assaults of the foeman and the deadlier ravages of time
have stripped this strong and graceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_28" id="page_28">{28}</a></span> monument of the beautiful tiles
or <i>azulejos</i> with which it was once adorned, and which seemed to have
earned for it its present name. No Danaë, alas! waits in this tower of
gold to-day for tyrant or deliverer. The place is occupied by clerks,
whose pens are ever busy recording the shipments of coal brought by
incoming steamers; and the immediate vicinity is infested by “tramp”
sailors of all nationalities, mostly British, for whose benefit,
presumably, rum, “Old Tom,” and other stimulating but unromantic
beverages are dispensed at kiosks and bars.</p>

<p>The spot appears to have been the scene of a picturesque episode
recounted by Contreras. It is worth repeating as revealing the polished
character of the dusky amirs who ruled in Ishbiliyah three hundred years
before Charles of Orleans devoted his declining years, in his palace by
the Loire, to the making of ballads, triolets, and rondeaux.</p>

<p>The Abbadite amir, Mut’adid-billah, was walking one day in the field of
Marchab Afida, on the banks of the Guadalquivir, and observed the breeze
ruffling the surface of the water. He improvised the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The breeze makes of the water a cuirass”&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="nind">and turning to the poet Aben Amr, called upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_29" id="page_29">{29}</a></span> him to complete the
verse. While the laureate was still in the throes of poetical
parturition, a young girl of the people who happened to be standing by,
anticipated him, and gave utterance to these original lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A cuirass strong, magnificent for combat,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As if the water had been frozen truly.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The prince was astonished at this display of the lyrical gift by a woman
of her condition, and ordered one of his eunuchs to conduct her to the
palace. On being questioned, she informed him that she was called
Romikiwa, because she was the slave of Romiya, and was a driver of
mules.</p>

<p>“Are you married?” asked the prince.</p>

<p>“No, sire.”</p>

<p>“It is well, for I shall buy you and marry you.”</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that Romikiwa’s merits as a wife exceeded her
abilities as a poetess.</p>

<p>The Alcazar, the palace inhabited by this dilettante amir and his
successors of the race of Abbad, continued to be the principal residence
of the subsequent rulers of Ishbiliyah, both Almoravides and Almohades.
There can be no doubt that the latter restored and reconstructed the
building to an extent that almost effaced the work of the founders. But
the impress of the Berber architects was in its turn almost entirely
lost when<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_30" id="page_30">{30}</a></span> the fabric came into the possession of the Christians. Thus
the Alcazar cannot be rightly classed among the monuments of the
Almohade period. It is certain that its extent at this time was greater
than it is now. Its enclosure was bounded by the city wall, which ran
down to the river, and occupied the whole angle formed by the two. The
Alcazar was then primarily a fortress, and its walls were flanked on
every side by watch-towers such as those with which its front is still
furnished. The principal entrance seems to have been at the Torre de la
Plata (silver tower), which was standing as late as 1821. Finally, among
the works of the last Musulman rulers of Seville, we must not omit to
mention the great aqueduct of four hundred and ten arches, called the
Caños de Carmona, constructed in 1172, which ensured the city an
abundant supply of water from the reservoir of Alcalá de Guadaira. The
Almohades had other palaces in the city. The old residence of Abdelasis
yet remained, and we hear of the palaces of St Hermenegildo and of the
Bib Ragel (or northern gate).</p>

<p>The Almohades kinged it nobly in Andalusia; but these successive
revivals of fervour and activity in Western Islam may be compared to the
last strong spasms of a dying man. Despite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_31" id="page_31">{31}</a></span> these furious inrushes of
Almoravides and Al-Muwahedun, the Christians were slowly but surely
gaining ground. The lieutenants of Abd-ul-Mumin subjugated Granada and
Almeria in the east, Badajoz and Evora in the west. The Moorish amir of
Valencia did homage to Yusuf, Abd-ul-Mumin’s son and successor, at
Ishbiliyah. The third sovereign of the dynasty, Yakub Al Mansûr, dealt
what seemed a crushing blow to the allied Spaniards at Alarcos in 1195.
Had that victory been properly followed up, perhaps to this day a
Mohammedan power might have been seated firmly in the south of Spain,
and the Strait of Gibraltar might have been a western Dardanelles.</p>

<p>But the Christians rallied. In 1212 was fought the decisive battle of
Las Navas de Tolosa, between the Moorish Khalif An-Nasr and the
Castilian King, Alfonso VIII. The Musulmans were totally defeated. “Six
hundred thousand combatants,” says El Makkari, with perhaps a trace of
Oriental hyperbole, “were led by An-Nasr to the field of battle; all
perished, except a few that did not amount to a thousand. This battle
was a malediction, not only on Andalus but on all the West.”</p>

<p>Yet the downfall of the Islamite power did not immediately follow.
An-Nasr survived his defeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_32" id="page_32">{32}</a></span> seven years, and his son, Abu Yusuf Yakub
Al-Mustanser, reigned four more inglorious years. His dying (1223)
without children was the signal for dissensions and disturbances
throughout his still vast empire. While Abd-ul-Wahed was proclaimed
Khalifa in Morocco, Al Adil took up the reins of sovereignty in Murcia.
Both pretenders soon disappeared from the troubled scene, Abd-ul-Wahed
being assassinated, and his rival, after having been defeated in Spain
by the Christians, being forced to take refuge in Morocco, there to
abdicate in favour of An-Nasr’s son, Yahya. Abu-l-Ala, Al Adil’s
brother, who had been left as governor in Ishbiliyah, declared himself
Khalifa on learning the accession of Yahya. He was the last of the race
of Abd-ul-Mumin to rule in the city. He was driven from Spain&mdash;to found
a wider empire in Africa&mdash;by Mohammed Ben Yusuf, variously styled Ben
Hud and Al Jodhami.</p>

<p>The storm-clouds were gathering fast over the beautiful city by the
Guadalquivir. Spain’s great national hero, St Ferdinand, now wore the
crown of Castile. He routed the Moors at Jerez, and in 1235 wrested from
them their most ancient and glorious metropolis, Cordova. The discord
and sedition which history shows are the usual prelude to the extinction
of a state, were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_33" id="page_33">{33}</a></span> wanting at Seville. Ben Hud died in 1238, and his
subjects turned once more in their despair to the African Almohades. But
no new army of Ghazis crossed the strait to do battle with the
Unbeliever. Despite their protestations of allegiance to the Khalifa of
Barbary, the Moors of Seville were left to fight their last fight
unassisted. When the Castilian army appeared before the walls, the
defence was directed, strangely enough for a Mohammedan community, by a
junta of six persons. Their names are worthy of being recorded: Abu
Faris, called by the Spaniards Axataf, Sakkáf, Shoayb, Ben Khaldûn, Ben
Khiyar, and Abu Bekr Ben Sharih.</p>

<p>The siege of Ishbiliyah lasted fifteen months. Material assistance was
lent to the Spaniards by Musulman auxiliaries, among them the Amirs of
Jaën and Granada. The Castilian fleet under Admiral Ramon Bonifaz
dispersed the Moorish ships, while the Sevillian land forces were driven
to take refuge within the walls. The Admiral succeeded in breaking the
chain stretched across the river, and thus cut off the garrison from
their principal magazines in the suburb of Triana. Only when in the
clutches of famine did the defenders ask for terms. They offered to give
up the city, on the condition that they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_34" id="page_34">{34}</a></span> allowed to demolish
the mosque. The Infante Alfonso replied that if a single brick were
displaced, the whole population would be put to the sword. The garrison
finally surrendered on the promise that all inhabitants who desired to
do so should be free to leave the city with their families and property,
and that those who elected to remain should pay the Castilian king the
same tribute they had hitherto paid to the native ruler. The brave Abu
Faris was invited to accept an honourable post under the conqueror, but
he magnanimously declined and retired to Africa. Thither thousands of
his countrymen followed him. Indeed, probably only a few thousand Moors
remained behind in Seville.</p>

<p>Ferdinand took possession on December 22nd, 1248. He took up his
residence in the Alcazar and allotted houses and territory to his
officers. It is worthy of remark that the first Christian soldier to
ascend the Giralda was a Scotsman named Lawrence Poore. Among the first
duties of the saintly king was the purification of the mosque and its
conversion into a Christian church.</p>

<p>Seville, after having remained in the hands of the Musulmans five
hundred and thirty-six years, had passed from them for ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_35" id="page_35">{35}</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="SEVILLE_UNDER_THE_CASTILIAN_KINGS" id="SEVILLE_UNDER_THE_CASTILIAN_KINGS"></a>SEVILLE UNDER THE CASTILIAN KINGS</h2>


<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">The</span> outward transformation of the Moorish Ishbiliyah into Seville, the
Christian capital, proceeded slowly and gradually. The personal devotion
and profound religious fervour of King Ferdinand notwithstanding, even
the war which resulted in the taking of the city cannot be regarded as a
crusade. As we have seen, Mohammedan troops fought under the banners of
the Christian king and contributed to his victory; and in the division
of the spoils these allies were not forgotten. Satisfied with their
triumph, the Castilians showed moderation in their treatment of their
Muslim subjects. The fall of Ishbiliyah was attended by no outburst of
iconoclastic fury. The conquerors were delighted with the beauty and
richness of their prize, and had no desire to impair the handiwork of
their predecessors.</p>

<p>The transition from the pure Arabic and Almohade styles of architecture
to what is called the Mudejar style was therefore almost imperceptible.
The physiognomy of the city altered but slowly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_36" id="page_36">{36}</a></span> But the alteration was
from the first inevitable. Houses and lands were bestowed on knights
from all parts of Spain on the condition of their residing permanently
in Seville. Catalans, Galicians, Castilians of all trades and ranks
flocked in, and their influence was bound sooner or later to assert
itself. But the builders and artisan class remained for many years
composed of Moors&mdash;sometimes Christianised, but thoroughly imbued with
the artistic traditions of their forebears. Thus came about that
peculiar and graceful blending of the Moorish and Gothic and earlier
Renaissance styles known to Spanish writers as the Mudejar. Its
differentiation from the Arabic naturally became more marked as the
centuries rolled by.</p>

<p>Moorish architecture was thus accepted by the conquerors of Seville both
from choice and necessity. But certain important modifications in the
structure of buildings became immediately necessary, owing to the
difference of faith and customs. The mosque and the dwelling-house alike
had to undergo some alteration. No <i>mihrab</i> was required, nor minaret,
nor the south-easterly position; in the dwelling-house there was no need
for harem, for retired praying-place, for the baths so dear to the
Andalusian Muslim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_37" id="page_37">{37}</a></span></p>

<p>Probably the first building of importance to be affected by the change
of rulers was the mosque. The outermost naves were divided into chapels,
the names and order of which have been preserved for us by Zuñiga
(quoted by Madrazo).</p>

<p>The royal chapel occupied the centre of the eastern wall; the other
chapels were: San Pedro, Santiago, Santa Barbara, San Bernardo, San
Sebastian (in this chapel were buried some Moors of the blood royal who
had been baptised and had served King Ferdinand, among them being Don
Fernando Abdelmon, son of Abu Seyt, Amir of Baeza), San Ildefonso, San
Francisco, San Andrés, San Clemente, San Felipe, San Mateo (containing
the sepulchre of the Admiral of Castile, Don Juan de Luna), Don Alonso
Perez de Guzman, San Miguel, San Marcos, San Lucas, San Bernabe, San
Simon, and San Judas, and the Magdalena. In the last-named chapel were
buried the knights who had taken part in the capture of the city.
Attached to it was the altar of Nuestra Señora de Pilar, a reputedly
miraculous shrine which became the objective of pilgrims in after years.</p>

<p>Chapels were also constructed in the four cloisters of the Patio de los
Naranjos. The cloister of the Caballeros contained eight&mdash;one of which,
Santa Lucia, was the place of sepulchre of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_38" id="page_38">{38}</a></span> the Haro family; the
cloister of the Granada contained three; the cloister of San Esteban,
three; the cloister of San Jorge or Del Lagarto, four&mdash;in one of which,
San Jorge, reposed that doughty warrior, Garci Perez de Vargas, who
distinguished himself before all his compeers at the assault of Seville.
This cloister was named Del Lagarto from the remains of an enormous
crocodile, a present from the Sultan of Egypt to King Alfonso el Sabio,
which are still suspended from the roof.</p>

<p>The cathedral&mdash;for so we must now call the mosque&mdash;was endowed and
richly embellished by St Ferdinand’s son and successor, the bookish
monarch Alfonso el Sabio. He also bestowed upon Seville its existing
coat-of-arms, consisting of the device NO8DO, which frequently appears,
to the bewilderment of strangers, on public buildings, uniforms, and
documents. The knot is in the vernacular <i>madeja</i>; the device thus reads
<i>no madeja do</i>, or, with an excusable pun, <i>no me ha dejado</i>&mdash;“it has
not deserted me.” This honourable motto the city won by its loyalty to
Alfonso during the civil wars which distracted the kingdom during his
reign. Seville bears the splendid title of “Most noble, most loyal, most
heroic, and unconquered city” (<i>muy noble</i>, <i>muy leal</i>, <i>muy heroica</i>,
<i>y<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_39" id="page_39">{39}</a></span> invicta</i>). The surname “most noble” was bestowed upon it by St
Ferdinand; the style “most faithful” it received from Juan II. in
remembrance of its resistance to the Infante Don Enrique; “most heroic”
from Fernando VII. in recognition of its devotion to the national cause
during the War of Independence; and “unconquered” from Isabel II. to
commemorate its defence against the army of Espartero in July 1843.</p>

<p>The successors of the sainted king made their home in the Alcazar, and
adapted themselves to an environment created by their traditional foes.
The personality which looms largest in the history of the city is that
of Don Pedro I., surnamed the Cruel, or, by his few admirers, ‘the
Justiciary.’ What Harun-al-Rashid is in the story of Bagdad is this
ferocious monarch in the annals of Seville. Countless are the tales, the
ballads, and traditions of which he is the subject. Curiously enough,
Pedro enjoyed a certain measure of popularity in the country he
misgoverned. He was undoubtedly a vigilant protector of the humbler
classes of his subjects against the tyranny of the aristocracy, and
officials, and appears to have combined a grim humour and a strain of
what we should now call Bohemianism, with a tiger-like ferocity. He was
fond of rambling <i>incognito</i> through the poorer<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_40" id="page_40">{40}</a></span> quarters of the city;
and no account of Seville can be considered complete without a relation
of one of his most notable adventures in the street called Calle de la
Cabeza de Don Pedro.</p>

<p>The king had promulgated a decree holding the municipal authorities
answerable with their lives for the preservation of peace and public
order within their jurisdiction. A few nights later, wandering, heavily
cloaked as we may suppose, through a dark alley, a gentleman brushed
rudely against him. A brawl ensued, swords were drawn, and Pedro ran his
subject through the body. Flattering himself that there had been no
witness to the encounter, he stalked away. In the morning the hidalgo’s
body was found, but there appeared to be no clue as to the assassin. The
king summoned the Alcalde and reminded him of the edict. If the
miscreant were not discovered within two days the luckless magistrate
must himself pay the penalty on the scaffold. It was a situation with
precisely the humorous aspect that Pedro relished.</p>

<p>But presently to the Alcalde came an old lady with a strange but welcome
story. She told how she had seen a fight between two gentlemen, the
previous night, from her bed-chamber window. She witnessed the fatal
termination, and lo! the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span> light of her candle fell full on the face of
the murderer; and as he bent forward, she heard his knee crack. By his
features and by this well-known physical peculiarity, she recognised,
beyond all possibility of a mistake, the king.</p>

<p>Next day the Alcalde invited his sovereign to attend the execution of
the criminal. Greatly wondering, no doubt, Pedro came. Dangling from a
rope he beheld his own effigy. “It is well,” he said, after an ominous
pause. “Justice has been done. I am satisfied.”</p>

<p>We may be inclined to disagree with the king’s conception of justice as
evinced on this occasion. More equitable and humorous was his action
when a priest, for murdering a shoemaker, was condemned by his
ecclesiastical superiors to suspension from his sacerdotal functions for
twelve months. Pedro thereupon decreed that any tradesman who slew a
priest should be punished by being restrained from exercising his trade
for the like period!</p>

<p>The catalogue of this Castilian monarch’s crimes proves interesting if
gloomy reading. He left his wife, Blanche de Bourbon, to perish in a
dungeon; he married Juana de Castro and insultingly repudiated her
within forty-eight hours; he put to death his father’s mistress, Leonor
de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span> Guzman. He threw the young daughter of his brother, Enrique de
Trastamara, naked to the lions, like some Christian virgin-martyr. But
the good-humoured (and possibly well-fed) brutes refused to touch the
proffered prey. Not wishing to be outdone in generosity by a wild beast,
Pedro ever afterwards treated the maiden kindly. She was known, in
remembrance of her terrible experience, as Leonor de los Leones.</p>

<p>The Jew, Don Simuel Ben Levi, had served Pedro long and only too
faithfully as treasurer and tax-gatherer. It was whispered in his
master’s ear that half the wealth that should fill the royal coffers was
diverted into his own. Ben Levi was seized without warning and placed on
the rack, where the noble Israelite is said to have died, not of pain,
but of pure indignation. Under his house&mdash;so the story has it&mdash;was a
cavern filled with three piles of gold and silver so high that a man
standing behind any one of them was completely hidden. “Had Don Simuel
given me the third of the least of these three piles,” exclaimed the
king, “I would not have had him tortured. Why would he rather die than
speak?”</p>

<p>Somewhat more excusable was the treatment meted out to the Red King of
Granada, Abu Saïd; for this prince was himself a usurper, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span>
behaved traitorously towards his own sovereign and his suzerain, the
King of Castile. Fearing Pedro’s resentment, he appeared at his court at
Seville with a retinue of three hundred, loaded with presents, among
which was the enormous ruby that now decorates the Crown of England. He
was received in audience by the Spanish king, whom he begged to
arbitrate between him and the deposed King of Granada. Pedro returned a
gracious reply, and entertained the Red King in the Alcazar. Before many
hours had passed the Moors were seized in their apartments and stripped
of their raiment and valuables. Abu Saïd, mounted on a donkey and
ridiculously attired, was taken, with thirty-six of his courtiers, to a
field outside the town. There they were bound to posts. A train of
horsemen appeared, Don Pedro among them, and transfixed the helpless men
with darts, the king shouting as he hurled his missiles at the luckless
Abu Saïd, “This for the treaty you made me conclude with Aragon!” “This
for the castle you lost me!” The Moors met their death with the stoical
resignation of their race.</p>

<p>That atrocities committed against Jews and infidels, against even
members of the royal family, should be regarded with indifference by the
public<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span> of that day need not surprise us. But the people of Seville
tamely suffered the most cruel wrongs to be inflicted by the tyrant on
their own fellow-citizens. After his (or rather the Black Prince’s)
victory over Don Enrique at Najera (1367), the Admiral Bocanegra and Don
Juan Ponce de Leon were beheaded on the Plaza San Francisco. Garci Jufre
Tenorio, the mayor of the city, also suffered death. The property of
Doña Teresa Jufre was confiscated because she had spoken ill of his
Majesty. Doña Urraca Osorio, because her son had taken part with Don
Enrique in the revolt, was burned at the stake on the Alameda. Her
servant, Leonor Dávalos, threw herself into the flames and shared the
fate of her mistress. In consequence of this persecution, Seville lost
several of her most illustrious families, which either became
extinguished or removed themselves to other parts of Spain.</p>

<p>So much for the picturesque if repugnant personality of Pedro I. With
his sinister memory the Alcazar is so intimately associated, and the
part he took in its reconstruction was so conspicuous that this may be
deemed the proper place to deal with that famous building&mdash;one of the
two most important in Seville.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="THE_ALCAZAR" id="THE_ALCAZAR"></a>THE ALCAZAR</h2>


<p class="nind">“<span class="smcap">The Alcazar</span>,” says Señor Rafaél Contreras, “is not a classic work, nor
does it present to-day that stamp of originality and that ineffaceable
character which distinguish ancient works like the Parthenon and modern
works like the Escorial. In the Alcazar of Yakub Yusuf the influence of
the heroic generation has faded away, and it portrays instead the daily
life of our Christian kings who have enriched it with a thousand pages
of glorious history. The Almohades, who impressed on the building their
African characteristics in 1181, and Jalubi, who had been a follower of
Al-Mehdi in the conquest of Africa, left on its walls traces of the
Roman influences met with in the course of their movements. St
Ferdinand, who conquered it, Don Pedro I., who restored it, Don Juan
II., who reconstructed the most elegant apartments, the Catholic
sovereigns, who built within its precincts chapels and oratories,
Charles V., who added more than a half in the modified style of that
epoch of the Renaissance, Philip III. and Philip V., who enlarged it
still more by build<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_46" id="page_46">{46}</a></span>ing in the adjacent gardens&mdash;these, and other
princes who inhabited it during six centuries, have changed the original
structure to such an extent that to-day it is far from being a monument
of oriental art, though we find it covered with fine arabesques and
embellished with mosaics and gilding.”</p>

<p>Though not a monument of oriental art, the Alcazar seems to us to have
claims to rank as a specimen of Moorish architecture; for the general
character of the structure was determined by the restorations effected
by order of Pedro I., and these were, probably exclusively, the work of
Moorish artisans, not only of Seville, but from Granada, then a Moorish
city. This accounts for the resemblance of this palace to the more
famous Alhambra. But the Alcazar is not to be dismissed as a mere
pseudo-Moorish palace. It remains, to a great extent, the work of
Moorish hands and the conception of Moorish architects.</p>

<p>In spite of the severe strictures of fastidious observers, the Alcazar
produces a very pleasing impression on northern visitors. Mr W. M.
Gallichan writes: “It is a palace of dreams, encircled by lovely
perfumed gardens. Its courts and salons are redolent of Moorish days and
haunted by the spirits of turbaned sheiks, philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_47" id="page_47">{47}</a></span>sophers, minstrels, and
dark-eyed beauties of the harem.... The nightingales still sing among
the odorous orange bloom, and in the tangles of roses birds still build
their nests. Fountains tinkle beneath gently moving palms; the savour of
orientalism clings to the spot. Here wise men discussed in the cool of
summer nights, when the moon stood high over the Giralda and white beams
fell through the spreading boughs of the lemon trees, and shivered upon
the tiled pavements.</p>

<p>“In this garden the musicians played and the tawny dancers writhed and
curved their lissome bodies, in dramatic Eastern dances. <i>Ichabod!</i> The
moody potentate, bowed down with the cares of high office, no longer
treads the dim corridor or lingers in the shade of the palm trees, lost
in cogitation. No sound of gaiety reverberates in the deserted courts;
no voice of orator is heard in the Hall of Justice. The green lizards
bask on the deserted benches of the gardens. Rose petals strew the paved
paths. One’s footsteps echo in the gorgeous <i>patios</i>, whose walls have
witnessed many a scene of pomp, tragedy, and pathos. The spell of the
past holds one; and before the imagination troops a long procession of
illustrious sovereigns, courtiers, counsellors, and menials.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_48" id="page_48">{48}</a></span></p>

<p>The Alcazar, as we have said, at the time of the reconquest covered a
much larger space than at present; and its area was even greater in the
days of Pedro I. Its strength as a fortress may be gauged by a glance at
the remaining walls, adjacent to the principal entrance. In the Plaza de
Santo Tomas is an octagonal, one-storeyed tower, called the Torre de
Abdalasis, which once formed part of the building, and is said to have
been the spot on which St Ferdinand hoisted his flag on the fall of
Seville. To enter the palace we pass across the Plaza del Triunfo and
enter the Patio de las Banderas, so called either because a flag was
hoisted here when the royal family were in residence or on account of
the trophy displayed over one of the arches, composed of the Arms of
Spain with supporting flags. From this court a colonnade called the
Apeadero leads to the Patio de la Monteria. It was built, as an
inscription over the portal records, by Philip III. in 1607, and
restored and devoted to the purposes of an armoury by the fifth
sovereign of that name in 1729. The Patio de la Monteria derives its
name from the Royal Lifeguards, the Monteros de Espinosa, having their
quarters here. These courts, with the commonplace private houses which
surround them, occupy the site of the old Moorish palace of the
Almo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_49" id="page_49">{49}</a></span>hades. Some of the houses exhibit vestiges of fine Musulman work.
The house No. 3 of the Patio de las Banderas formed part, in the opinion
of Gestoso y Perez, of the Stucco Palace (Palacio del Yeso) mentioned by
Ayala as having been built by Pedro I. That potentate, it is worthy of
remark, was accustomed to administer justice, tempered with ferocity,
after the oriental fashion, seated on a stone bench in a corner of this
<i>patio</i>. The room in which the Almohade governors presided over their
tribunals still exists. It is surrounded by houses, and is entered from
the Patio de la Monteria. Contreras sees in this hall (the Sala de
Justicia) the traces of a work anterior to the ninth century. It was,
however, restored by Pedro. It is square, and measures nine metres
across. The ceiling is of stucco and adorned with stars, wreaths, and a
painted frieze. Inscriptions in beautiful Cufic characters constitute
the principal decoration of the apartment. Round the four walls runs a
tastefully worked stucco frieze, interrupted by several right-angled
apertures. These were once covered, in the opinion of Herr Schmidt, by
screens of plaster, which kept out the sun’s heat but admitted the
light; or, according to Gestoso y Perez, by tapestries “which must have
made the hall appear a miracle of wealth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_50" id="page_50">{50}</a></span> splendour.” Thanks to its
isolation, the Sala de Justicia escaped the “restoration” effected in
the middle of the nineteenth century by order of the Duc de Montpensier.</p>

<p>It was in this hall (often overlooked by visitors) that Don Pedro
overheard four judges discussing the division of a bribe they had
received. They were beheaded on the spot, and their skulls are still to
be seen in the walls of the king’s bed-chamber.</p>

<p>From the Patio de la Monteria we pass into the Patio del Leon. In the
fifteenth century, we read, tournaments were often held here. Our
attention is at once directed to the superb façade of the main building
or Alcazar proper&mdash;the palace of Don Pedro. It is a splendid work of
art. The columns are of rare marble with elegant Moorish capitals. The
portal is imposing, and was rebuilt by Don Pedro, as the legend in
curious Gothic characters informs us: ‘The most high, the most noble,
the most powerful, and most victorious Don Pedro, King of Castile and
Leon, commanded these palaces, these alcazares, and these entrances to
be made in the year [of Cæsar] one thousand four hundred and two”
(1364). Elsewhere on the façade are the oft-repeated inscriptions in
Cufic characters: “There is no conqueror but Allah,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_51" id="page_51">{51}</a></span> “Glory to our
lord, the Sultan,” “Eternal glory to Allah,” “Eternal is the dominion of
Allah,” etc.</p>

<p>This gate, in the opinion of Contreras, is of Arabic origin and in the
Persian style, after which were built most of the entrances to mosques
of the first period. The square opening is often seen in Egypt, and
supplanted the more graceful horse-shoe arch. The pilasters are Arabic
throughout; but the arch balconies, the Byzantine columns, and Roman
capitals are works of Don Pedro’s time.</p>

<p>The palace of the Alcazar forms an irregular oblong. The Patio de las
Doncellas or Patio Principal occupies the centre, roughly speaking, and
upon it open the various halls and chambers according to the usual
Moorish plan. This <i>patio</i> is absurdly named from its being the supposed
place in which were collected the hundred damsels said to have been sent
by way of annual tribute by Mauregato to the Moors. It is hardly
necessary to say that the damsels would have been sent to Cordova, which
was the capital of the Khalifate, not to Seville, and that this court
was among the restorations of the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The court is rectangular, and surrounded by a gallery composed of white
marble columns in pairs, supporting pointed arches. The soffite (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_52" id="page_52">{52}</a></span>
inner side) of the arch is scalloped or serrated. The central arch in
each side is higher and larger than its fellows, and springs from square
imposts resting on the twin columns. At each angle of the impost is a
graceful little pillar&mdash;“a characteristic,” observes Madrazo, “of the
Arabic-Grenadine architecture, such as may often be noticed in the
magnificent Alhambra of the Alhamares.” Over the arches runs a flowing
scroll with Arabic inscriptions, among them being “Glory to our lord the
Sultan Don Pedro; may God lend him His aid and render him victorious”,
and this very remarkable text, “There is but one God; He is eternal. He
was not begotten and does not beget, and He has no equal.” This is
evidently an inscription remaining from Musulman days, and spared in
their ignorance by the Christian owners of the palace. On the frieze
will also be noticed the escutcheons of Don Pedro and the Catholic
sovereigns, and the favourite devices of Charles V.&mdash;the Pillars of
Hercules and motto “Plus Oultre.” Behind the central arches are as many
doors with elaborately ornamented arches. On either side of each door is
a double window, framed with broad, ornamental bands, with conventional
floral designs. Round the inner walls of the arcade runs a high dado of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_53" id="page_53">{53}</a></span>
glazed tile mosaic (<i>azulejo</i>), brilliantly coloured and cut with
exquisite skill. The combinations and variations of the design repay
examination, and will be seen to extend all round the gallery. This
decoration was probably executed by Moorish workmen in the time of Pedro
I. Finally, above the doors run wide friezes with shuttered windows,
through which the light falls on the gleaming mosaic. The ceiling of the
gallery dates from the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, but was restored
in 1856.</p>

<p>Three recesses in the <i>patio</i> are pointed out as the spots where Don
Pedro held his audiences; but Contreras is of opinion that they are the
walled-up entrances to former corridors which communicated with the
Harem. That apartment probably faced the Salón de los Embajadores.</p>

<p>A wide cornice separates the lower part of the court from the upper
gallery. This is composed of balustrades, arches, and columns in white
marble of the Ionic order, and was the work of Don Luis de Vega
(sixteenth century).</p>

<p>One of the doors opening on to the Patio de las Doncellas gives access
to the Salón de los Embajadores (Hall of the Ambassadors), the finest
apartment in the Alcazar. Its dazzling splendour is produced by the
blending of five distinct styles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_54" id="page_54">{54}</a></span> the Arabic, Almohade or true Moorish,
Gothic, Grenadine or late Moorish, and Renaissance. Measuring about
thirty-three feet square, it has four entrances, of which that giving on
to the Patio de las Doncellas may be considered the principal. Here we
find folding-doors in the Arabic style of extraordinary size and beauty.
Each wing is 5.30 metres high by 1.97 broad, and adorned with painted
inlaid work, varied by Arabic inscriptions. One of these latter is of
great interest. It runs as follows: “Our Lord and Sultan, the exalted
and high Don Pedro, King of Castile and Leon (may Allah prosper him and
his architect), ordered these doors of carved wood to be made for this
apartment (in honour of the noble and fortunate ambassadors), which is a
source of joy to the happy city, in which the palaces, the alcazares,
and these mansions for my Lord and Master were built, who only showed
forth his splendour. The pious and generous Sultan ordered this to be
done in the city of Seville with the aid of his intercessor [Saint
Peter?] with God. Joy shone in their delightful construction and
embellishment. Artificers from Toledo were employed in the work; and
this took place in the fortunate year 1404 [1364 <small>A.D.</small>]. Like the evening
twilight and the refulgence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_55" id="page_55">{55}</a></span> the twilight of the aurora is this work.
A throne resplendent in brilliant colours and eminence. Praise be to
Allah!”</p>

<p>The three remaining portals present graceful round arches, enclosing
three lesser arches (forming the actual entrances) of the horse-shoe
type. These last are believed, as we have said elsewhere, to be of
Abbadite origin. The capitals of their supporting columns are fine
examples of the Arab-Byzantine style. Above the horse-shoe arches, and
comprised within the outer arch, are three lattices. The whole space
within the arch is covered with delicate filigree work.</p>

<p>This hall was once known as the Salón de la Media Naranja (Hall of the
Half Orange) from the elegant shaping of its carved wooden ceiling. This
rests upon a frieze decorated with the Tower and Lion, and supporting
this again are beautiful carved and gilded stalactites or pendants. On
the intervening wall spaces are Cufic inscriptions on a blue ground, and
female heads painted by sixteenth-century vandals. Then follows another
frieze with the devices of Castile and Leon, below which is a row of
fifty-six niches, containing the portraits of the kings of Spain from
Receswinto the Goth to Philip III. The earliest of these seem to have
been painted in the sixteenth century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_56" id="page_56">{56}</a></span> while the little columns and
trefoil windows that separate them may be ascribed to the end of the
fourteenth. The series is interrupted by four rectangular spaces,
formerly occupied by windows, but now taken up by elegant balconies in
wrought iron, the work of Francisco López (1592). The decoration of this
magnificent chamber is completed by a high dado of white, blue, and
green glazed tiles. It was probably in this hall that Abu Saïd, “the Red
King,” was received by Don Pedro prior to his murder.</p>

<p>In an apartment to the right of the Ambassadors’ Hall, a plaster frieze
of Arabic origin, showing figures in silhouette, may be noticed; and in
a room to the left, other silhouettes, apparently referring to the
qualities attributed by his admirers to Pedro I.</p>

<p>On the north side of the Patio de las Doncellas lies the so-called
Dormitorio de los Reyes Moros (Bed-chamber of the Moorish Kings). The
entrance arch is semicircular, and includes three graceful lattice
windows, richly ornamented. On either side of the door is a beautiful
double-window with columns dating from the Khalifate. The doors
themselves are richly inlaid, and painted with geometrical patterns. The
interior of the chamber is adorned, like all other apartments in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_57" id="page_57">{57}</a></span> the
Alcazar, with plaster friezes, and is so richly decorated that scarcely
a hand’s-breadth (remarks Herr Schmidt) is without ornamentation. To the
right of the entrance lies a small apartment known as the Sultan’s
Alcove. Opposite the entrance from the <i>patio</i> are three horse-shoe
arches belonging to the earliest period of Spanish-Arabic art, leading
to an <i>Al-Hami</i> or alcove.</p>

<p>From the Dormitorio we may pass into the quaintly named Patio de las
Muñecas, or Puppet’s Court. It is a spot with tragical associations, for
here took place the murder of the Master of Santiago, Don Fadrique de
Trastamara, by his brother, Don Pedro&mdash;a fratricide to be avenged years
after by another fratricide at Montiel. The Master, after a campaign in
Murcia, had been graciously received by the king, and went to pay his
respects to the lovely Maria de Padilla in another part of the palace.
It is said that she warned him of his impending fate; perhaps her
manner, if not her words, should have aroused him to a sense of his
danger; but the soldier prince returned to the royal presence. “Kill the
Master of Santiago!” Pedro shouted, so the story goes. The Master’s
sword was entangled in his scarf; he was separated from his retinue. He
fled to this court, where he was struck down. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_58" id="page_58">{58}</a></span> his retainers took
refuge in Maria de Padilla’s apartment, where he tried to screen himself
by holding the king’s daughter, Doña Beatriz, before his breast. Pedro
tore the child away, and despatched the unfortunate man with his own
hand.</p>

<p>The Patio de las Muñecas is in the Grenadine style. It has suffered
severely at the hands of the restorers of 1833 and 1843. The arches are
semicircular and spring from brick pillars, which are supported by
marble columns with rich capitals. The arches, which form an arcade
round the court, are decorated with fine mosaic and trellis (<i>ajaraca</i>)
work. The whole is tastefully painted. The arches vary in size, that
looking towards the Ambassadors’ Hall being almost pear-shaped. The
columns are of different colours, and the pillars they uphold are
inscribed with Cufic characters. The upper part of the <i>patio</i> reveals a
not very skilful attempt to imitate the lower.</p>

<p>“The Ambassadors’ Hall as well as the Puppet’s Court,” says Pedro de
Madrazo, “are surrounded by elegant saloons, commencing at the principal
façade of the Alcazar, running round the north-west angle of the
building, adjoining the galleries of the gardens del Principe, de la
Gruta, and de la Danza, and terminating at the south-eastern angle of
the Patio de las Doncellas. Here is now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_59" id="page_59">{59}</a></span> chapel, and there it is
believed that the luxurious apartment of the Caracol (inhabited by Maria
de Padilla) stood. This part was, without doubt, that which was called
the Palacio del Yeso, or Stucco Palace, on account of the plaster
decorations in the fashion of Granada; but in which of these rooms Don
Pedro was playing draughts when the Master of Santiago appeared before
him, it is impossible to say with certainty.”</p>

<p>The Salón del Principe occupies the upper floor of the chief façade, and
receives light through the beautiful <i>ajimices</i> or twin-windows so
noticeable from without. This spacious hall is divided into three
compartments, each of which has a fine ceiling. Two have been restored,
but the third was the work of Juan de Simancas in the year 1543. The
scheme of decoration is Moorish. The columns in this hall and the
adjoinng apartments are of marble, with rich capitals. According to
Zurita (quoted by Madrazo), these columns came from the royal palace at
Valencia, after the defeat of Pedro of Aragon by the King of Castile.</p>

<p>The oratory was built by order of Ferdinand and Isabella in 1504. It
contains an admirable retablo in blue glazed tiles&mdash;probably the finest
work of the kind in Spain&mdash;designed by an Italian, Francesco Niculoso.
The centre-piece represents<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_60" id="page_60">{60}</a></span> the Visitation. It is believed that some
parts of the work were drawn by Pedro Millán, a sculptor of Seville.</p>

<p>The oratory is on the upper floor of the palace. On the same storey is
the Comedor, or dining-hall, a long, narrow room with a fine
fifteenth-century ceiling, and good tapestries on the walls. A more
interesting apartment is the bed-chamber of Don Pedro, which has a good
carved roof and dados of <i>azulejos</i> and stucco. Over the door four heads
may be seen painted. They represent the skulls of the corrupt judges on
whom the unjust king executed summary justice. The decoration of this
chamber is of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The royal apartments on this floor contain several important works of
art. In the room of the Infantes is a portrait of Maria Luisa by Goya.
The Salón Azul (Blue Room), so-called from the colour of its tapestries,
contains some fine pastel paintings by Muraton, and some notable
miniatures on ivory. The portraits of the family of Isabel II. by
Bartolomé López are worthy of inspection.</p>

<p>Returning to the ground floor, we enter the spacious Salón de Carlos V.,
occupying one side of the Patio de las Doncellas. Here, it is asserted,
St Ferdinand died; but it is more probable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_61" id="page_61">{61}</a></span> he expired in the old
Moorish Alcazar. The fine ceiling, decorated with the heads of warriors
and ladies, was built by the Emperor after whom the hall is named. The
stucco and the work are very beautiful.</p>

<p>An uninteresting apartment was erected by Ferdinand VI. over the famous
Baths of Maria de Padilla, which are approached through an arched
entrance, and, surrounded by thick walls, have more the appearance of a
dungeon than of a resort of Love and Beauty. The pool still remains
where the lovely favourite bathed her fair limbs. In her time it had no
other roof than the blue sky of Andalusia, and no further protection
from prying eyes than that afforded by the orange and lemon trees. At
Pedro’s court it was esteemed a mark of gallantry and loyalty to drink
the waters of the bath, after Maria had performed her ablutions.
Observing that one of his knights refrained from this act of homage, the
king questioned him and elicited the reply, “I dare not drink of the
water, lest, having tasted the sauce, I should covet the partridge.”
These baths were no doubt used by the ladies of the harem in Moorish
days.</p>

<p>The gardens of the Alcazar form a delicious pleasaunce, where the orange
and the citron diffuse their fragrance, and fairy-like fountains spring
up<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_62" id="page_62">{62}</a></span> suddenly beneath the unwary passenger’s feet, sprinkling him with a
cooling and perhaps not unwelcome dew. But this paradise has its
serpent, and that is the truculent shade of the cruel king, which for
ever seems to haunt the Alcazar. Here Pedro prowled one day, when four
candidates for the office of judge presented themselves before him. To
test their fitness for the post, the king pointed to an orange floating
on the surface of a pool close by. He asked each of the lawyers in
succession what the floating object was. The three first replied without
consideration, “An orange, sire.” But the fourth drew the fruit from the
water with his staff, glanced at it, and replied with absolute accuracy,
“<i>Half</i> an orange, sire.” He was appointed to the vacant magistracy.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Alcazar, we will briefly summarise the history of its
transformations and reconstructions. As we have seen, the palace
generally may be considered the work of Don Pedro. In the reign of Juan
II., the Salón de los Embajadores was enriched with its fine cupola. A
tablet, discovered in 1843, testifies that the architect was Don Diego
Roiz, and that the artisans employed in the work were made freemen of
the city.</p>

<p>Various parts of the building were built or re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_63" id="page_63">{63}</a></span>constructed by order of
Ferdinand and Isabella. The architects were for the most part
Christianised Moors, among whom are mentioned Maestre Mohammed Agudo
(1479), Juan Fernandez (1479), Diego Fernandez (1496), and Francisco
Fernandez. The latter was appointed Master of the Alcazar in 1502, and
previous to his adoption of Catholicism was named Hamet Kubeji.
According to Gestoso y Perez, a surprising number of artificers and
craftsmen were engaged about the Alcazar at this time, a powerful
inducement being exemption from taxes and military service. The names of
Juan and Francisco de Limpias (1479-1540) have been preserved among the
carpenters; and Diego Sanchez (1437), Alfonso Ruiz (1479), and the two
Sanchez de Castro (1500), among the painters.</p>

<p>Several improvements were carried out under Charles V. and Philip II.,
and a great deal of restoration was unfortunately necessitated by the
fires which seemed to break out with increasing frequency during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Still more disastrous was the
effect of the great earthquake of 1755. Then began the reign of the
vandal, which did more damage to the palace than time, fire, and
earthquake combined.</p>

<p>In 1762, the minister Wall ordered the Alcazar to be repaired in “the
modern manner.” The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_64" id="page_64">{64}</a></span> ceilings which had been destroyed by fire were
replaced by others much too low, and valuable arabesques were recklessly
sacrificed. In 1805, some director with a genius for transmogrification
whitewashed the fine stucco work in the Salon del Principe, and altered
the main entrance. He also substituted a plaster ceiling for the
bowl-shaped Arab roofing, and made strenuous efforts to impair the
beauty of the Ambassadors’ Hall. In 1833 a reaction took place. Don
Joaquin Cortes and Señor Raso effected an artistic and sympathetic
restoration both of the Prince’s Hall and the Patio de las Muñecas. A
more serious restoration was begun in 1842, at the instance of the
administrator, Don Domingo de Alcega. The artist Becquer contributed
materially to the success of the work. In the ’fifties, the task of
replacing and restoring the stucco ornamentation was completed; and
under Isabel II. the thirty-six arches of the Patio de las Doncellas
were restored. Since that date the reconstructions have not always
displayed good taste; but the revival of interest in her ancient
monuments which has taken place in Spain of late years encourages us to
hope, at least, that the appalling blunders of the early nineteenth
century will never be repeated.</p>

<p>After the Alcazar, the most noteworthy monu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_65" id="page_65">{65}</a></span>ment in Seville, dating from
the reign of Don Pedro, is the church of Omnium Sanctorum. This edifice
occupies the site of a Roman temple, and was built by the Cruel King in
1356. It exhibits a very happy combination of the Moorish and Gothic
styles. It is entered by three ogival doors, and is divided into three
naves. To the left of the façade is a graceful tower, the first storey
of which is Moorish, ornamented somewhat after the style of the Giralda.
On one of the doors is a shield bearing the arms of Portugal, which,
tradition says, commemorates the pious generosity of Diniz, king of that
country, when he visited Alfonso the Wise. If the Sevillians have writ
their annals true, this goes to prove that an earlier structure than the
present must have existed here. This, by the way, was the parish church
of Rioja the poet.</p>

<p>San Lorenzo exhibits the fusion of the contending styles in an
interesting fashion. It has five naves; and the horseshoe windows in its
tower were converted into ogives at the time of its adaptation to the
Christian cult. The arcades of the naves are ogival in the middle, and
become by degrees semi-circular towards the extremities as the roof
becomes lower. This church contains <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_66" id="page_66">{66}</a></span>the miraculous picture of Nuestra
Señora de Rocamadour. Rocamadour, in southern France, was a celebrated
shrine of pilgrims in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Several other churches in Seville date from this epoch, and present, to
a greater or less extent, evidences of the conflict between the Moorish
and Gothic styles. In addition to those mentioned, Madrazo names the
following: Santa Marina, San Ildefonso, San Vicente, San Julián, San
Esteban, Santa Catalina, San Andrés, San Miguel, San Nicolas, San
Martin, San Gil, Santa Lucia, San Pedro, and San Isidoro. When a mosque
was converted into a Christian church, the same authority remarks, the
horseshoe arch was pointed, bells were placed in the minaret, and the
orientation was altered from north to south, to east to west. The five
last-named churches were erected in the thirteenth century. Santa Maria
de las Nieves was, until the year 1391, a synagogue. The decoration is
in the plateresco style, and the doors are Gothic. The church contains a
painting by Luis de Vargas, and a picture attributed to Murillo.</p>

<p>Nearly in the centre of the city is the Convent of Santa Inés, with a
beautiful and tastefully restored chapel. The façade is ancient and
graceful. This church contains the remains (said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_67" id="page_67">{67}</a></span> be uncorrupted) of
the foundress, Doña Maria Coronel, one of Don Pedro’s numerous victims.
That monarch had conceived a violent passion for her, in the hopes of
gratifying which he put her husband to death in the Torre del Oro. The
widow, far from yielding to his solicitations, took the veil, and at
last, to secure herself from his persecutions, destroyed her beauty by
means of vitriol&mdash;a species of self-immolation much applauded by the
devout in the ages of faith. Her sister, Doña Aldonza, was less
successful in resisting the ardent monarch, but died, in the odour of
sanctity, Abbess of Santa Inés.</p>

<p>Among the secular buildings erected under the Castilian <i>régime</i> was the
existing Tower of Don Fadrique, standing in the gardens of the Convent
of the Poor Clares. It was named after the son of St Ferdinand and
Beatriz of Swabia, who was put to death by Alfonso el Sabio in 1276. The
tower is a fine square structure of Roman workmanship, seemingly, in its
lowest floor, and showing a mixture of Moorish and Gothic architecture
in its upper half. It formed part of a sumptuous palace erected in 1252,
and bestowed in 1289 on the Poor Clares by King Sancho the Brave.</p>

<p>In the Calle Guzman el Bueno is a mansion<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_68" id="page_68">{68}</a></span> called the Casa Olea. It
contains a fine hall, 8½ metres square, the work of Moorish artisans of
the time of Don Pedro. The beautiful inlaid and gilded <i>artesonado</i>
ceiling was removed about a century ago; light is admitted through
windows of the horseshoe pattern, and the decorations consist of the
characteristic stucco-work, latticing, and <i>ajaraca</i> or trellis-work, as
fine as any to be seen at the Lindaraja of Granada. The dado of coloured
tiles has almost completely disappeared. The Palacio de Montijo, near
the church of Omnium Sanctorum, reveals many traces of Mudejar
workmanship, as also does a hall in the <i>Casa morisca</i> of the Calle de
Abades&mdash;not to be confounded with the Casa de Abades, belonging to the
Renaissance.</p>

<p>Seville in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries possessed no doubt
many palaces and private dwellings of magnificence; but it was in
ecclesiastical architecture that the spirit of the age found its truest
expression and noblest monuments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_69" id="page_69">{69}</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="THE_CATHEDRAL" id="THE_CATHEDRAL"></a>THE CATHEDRAL</h2>


<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">On</span> the eighth day of July in the year 1401, the Dean and Chapter of
Seville assembled in the Court of the Elms, and solemnly resolved that,
the Cathedral having been practically ruined by recent earthquakes, a
new one should be built so splendid that it should have no equal; and
that, if the revenue of the See should not prove sufficient for the cost
of the undertaking, each one present should contribute from his own
stipend as much as might be necessary. Then uprose a zealous prebendary,
and cried, “Let us build a church so great that those who come after us
may think us mad to have attempted it!”</p>

<p>Such was the greatness of spirit in which the foundation of the existing
Cathedral of Seville was undertaken. And the result is worthy of the
deep and fervid zeal of those old Catholics of Spain.</p>

<p>The church took one hundred and twenty years to build. Pity it was that
the noble-hearted priests who decreed the raising of the fane should
never have gazed upon much more than its skeleton! First of all, the
mosque-cathedral of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_70" id="page_70">{70}</a></span> Yakub was demolished, only the Giralda and the
<i>Patio de los Naranjos</i>, with the northern, eastern, and western gates,
being spared. The Royal Chapel was pulled down in 1432, by permission of
Juan II. The first stone had been laid in 1402; but, strangely and sadly
enough, the name of the architect who traced the plan has not been
preserved. Some believe him to have been Alonso Martinez; others, Pero
García. Fame, we may well believe, was a prize which the pious builder
esteemed but lightly. His reward lay in the greater glorification of his
faith.</p>

<p>In 1462, we find Juan Normán directing the works; in 1488, he had passed
from the scene and was succeeded by Juan de Hoz. Then came Alonso Ruiz
and Alonso Rodriguez. The building was practically finished when, in
1511, the cupola collapsed. In 1519, Juan Gil de Hontañon, the architect
of Salamanca Cathedral, completed the reconstruction, and the cathedral
may be considered as having been finished, though restorations and
remodelling of various parts of the edifice have been going on ever
since, and masons are to this day engaged upon the dome.</p>

<p>This magnificent church is pre-eminent for size among the cathedrals of
Spain, and ranks third in this respect among the sacred edifices of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_71" id="page_71">{71}</a></span>
world. St Peter’s covers 230,000 square feet, the Mezquita at Cordova
160,000, and the Cathedral of Seville 125,000. Our St Paul’s covers only
84,000 square feet. It follows that this cathedral is the largest of
Gothic temples.</p>

<p>So stupendous a monument has naturally attracted comment from
distinguished travellers and critics. All have come under the spell of
its majesty and massive nobility. Théophile Gautier expressed himself as
follows: “The most extravagant and most monstrously prodigious Hindoo
pagodas are not to be mentioned in the same century as the Cathedral of
Seville. It is a mountain scooped out, a valley turned topsy-turvy;
Notre Dame de Paris might walk erect in the middle nave, which is of
frightful height; pillars with the girth of towers, and which appear so
slender that they make you shudder, rise out of the ground or descend
from the vaulted roof, like stalactites in a giant’s grotto.”</p>

<p>The Italian, De Amicis, is less fantastical in his rhapsodies. “At your
first entrance, you are bewildered, you feel as if you are wandering in
an abyss, and for several moments you can only glance around in this
vast spaciousness, to assure yourself that your eyes do not deceive you,
that your fancy is playing you no trick; you approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_72" id="page_72">{72}</a></span> one of the
pillars, measure it, and look at those in the distance; though large as
towers, they appear so slender that you tremble to think the building is
resting upon them. You traverse them with a glance from floor to
ceiling, and it seems that you could almost count the moments it would
take for the eye to climb them.... In the central aisle, another
cathedral, with its cupola and bell-tower, could easily stand.”</p>

<p>Lomas, who is no great admirer of the building, admits that “the first
view of the interior is one of the supreme moments of a lifetime. The
glory and majesty of it are almost terrible. No other building, surely,
is so fortunate as this in what may be called its presence.”</p>

<p>The Cathedral is oblong in shape, and is 414 feet long by 271 feet wide.
The nave is 100 feet and the dome 121 feet high.</p>

<p>The principal façade looks west. Here is the principal entrance (Puerta
Mayor), and two side doors, the Puertas de San Miguel and del Bautismo.
Over the central door is a fine relief, representing the Assumption, by
Ricardo Bellver, placed here in 1885. This entrance is elaborately
decorated, and adorned with thirty-two statues in niches.</p>

<p>The Puertas San Miguel and del Bautismo are<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_73" id="page_73">{73}</a></span> decorated with terra-cotta
statues of saints and prelates, the work of Pedro Millan, a
fifteenth-century sculptor. Herr Schmidt thinks very highly of these
fine performances. Each figure has life and distinct personality, and
the treatment of the drapery harmonises wonderfully with the gestures
and physiognomy of the wearers. The upper part of the façade is poor,
and dates only from 1827.</p>

<p>The southern façade is flanked by sacristies, offices, and courts, above
which appear the graceful flying buttresses, gargoyles, and windows, and
the majestic dome of the main building. In the middle of this side is a
modern entrance, the Puerta de San Cristóbal, added by Casanova in 1887.
In the eastern façade are two entrances&mdash;the Puertas de las Campanillas
and de los Palos&mdash;both enriched with fine sculpture by Pedro Millan; the
Puerta de los Palos has also a fine Adoration of the Magi by Miguel
Florentin (1520).</p>

<p>On the northern side of the Cathedral we find the most important remains
of the pre-existing mosque, the Giralda, already described, and the
<i>Patio de los Naranjos</i>, with the original fountain at which the Muslims
performed their ablutions. The <i>patio</i> is entered from the street by the
Puerta del Perdón, a richly decorated horseshoe arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_74" id="page_74">{74}</a></span> erected by Moorish
hands by order of Alfonso XI., to commemorate the victory of the Salado
in the year 1340. In the sixteenth century this door was restored and
adorned with sculptures. The colossal statues of Saints Peter and Paul,
in terra-cotta, are the work of Miguel Florentin. He was among the
earliest of the Renaissance sculptors to settle in Spain. By him also is
the relief of the Expulsion of the Money-Changers from the Temple,
celebrating the substitution of the Lonja or Bourse for this gate as a
rendezvous for merchants. The plateresco work was executed by Bartolomé
López in 1522. The doors date from Alfonso’s reign, and are faced with
bronze plates, on which are Arabic inscriptions.</p>

<p>Close to the Puerta del Perdón is a shrine built in the wall with a
Christ on the Cross by Luis de Vargas.</p>

<p>Entering the <i>patio</i>, to the right we find the Sagrario, or parish
church, and to the left (reached by a staircase) the Biblioteca
Colombina or Chapter Library, founded by Fernando Colon, son of
Christopher Columbus. Among the treasures it contains are a manuscript
of the great discoverer’s travels, with notes in his own hand; a
manuscript tract, written by him in prison, to prove that the existence
of America was not contrary to Scripture;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_75" id="page_75">{75}</a></span> the sword of Garcia Perez de
Vargas, the great hero of the conquest of Seville, and a very
interesting thirteenth-century translation of the Bible.</p>

<p>The northern façade of the Cathedral is entered through three portals,
the westernmost of which, the Puerta del Sagrario, is unfinished. The
Puerta de los Naranjos and the Puerta del Lagarto lead from the <i>patio</i>.
The Puerta del Lagarto retains some traces of its Moorish origin. It is
named after the patched and painted stuffed alligator, which has hung
here since about the thirteenth century. Here may also be seen a huge
elephant’s tusk, and a bridle said to have belonged to the Cid.</p>

<p>Referring more particularly to the exterior of the Cathedral, Caveda
says: “The general effect is truly majestic. The open-work parapets
which crown the roofs, the graceful lanterns of the eight winding stairs
that ascend in the corners to the vaults and galleries, the flying
buttresses that spring lightly from aisle to nave, as the jets of a
cascade from cliff to cliff, the slender pinnacles that cap them, the
proportions of the arms of the transept and of the buttresses supporting
the side walls, the large pointed windows that open, one above another,
just as the aisles and chapels to which they belong rise over each
other, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_76" id="page_76">{76}</a></span> pointed portals and entrances&mdash;all these combine in an
almost miraculous manner, although lacking the wealth of detail, the
airy grace, and the delicate elegance that characterise the cathedrals
of Léon and Burgos.”</p>

<p>Entering the church, the gloom renders it difficult for a time to
distinguish its exact configuration. We find it is divided into a nave
and four aisles, the former being fifty feet in width. The fine marble
floor was laid in the years 1787 to 1795. There is little ornamentation,
the interior displaying a noble simplicity, the beautiful effect being
produced mainly by the grandeur and symmetry of the vaultings, archings,
and pillars. The seventy-four exquisite stained-glass windows, however,
form a decorative series of the richest kind. They are, for the most
part, the work of northern artists. Micer Cristóbal Aleman (Master
Christoph the German) began the first&mdash;the first stained-glass window
seen in Seville&mdash;in 1504, the work being carried on by the German
Heinrich, the Flemings Bernardino of Zeeland and Juan Bernardino, Carlos
of Bruges, and the great master Arnao of Flanders. The two latter
designers are said to have received ninety thousand ducats for their
work. The last window was completed in 1662 by a Spaniard named Juan
Bautista de Léon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_77" id="page_77">{77}</a></span> The finest windows are generally considered to be
those representing the Ascension, St Mary Magdalen, Lazarus, and the
Entry into Jerusalem, by Arnao the Fleming and his brother (1525), and
the Resurrection, by Carlos of Bruges (1558).</p>

<p>Passing up the nave, from the Puerta Mayor, we find midway between that
entrance and the choir the Tomb of Fernando Colon, son of the great
Columbus&mdash;“who would have been considered a great man,” says Ford, “had
he been the son of a less great father.” The slab is engraved with
pictures of the discoverer’s vessels, and the inscription, <i>À Castilla y
á León Mundo nuevo dio Colon</i>. At this spot, during Holy Week, is set up
the <i>Monumento</i>, an enormous wooden temple in the shape of a Greek
cross, in which the Sacrament is enshrined. The structure was made by
Antonio Florentin in 1544.</p>

<p>Extending to the middle of the nave is the Coro or Choir, open towards
the east or High Altar. The <i>trascoro</i> or choir-screen is faced with
marbles, eight columns of red <i>breccia</i> being especially fine. The
marble reliefs are fine examples of Genoese work. Over the altar is a
fourteenth-century painting of the Madonna, and there is also a picture
by Pacheco, the inquisitor, representing St Ferdinand receiving the keys
of Seville from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_78" id="page_78">{78}</a></span> “Axataf.” The side walls of the choir accommodate four
little chapels, exhibiting a harmonious combination of the Gothic and
plateresco styles in translucent alabaster. The Capilla de la Concepcion
contains one of the finest examples of statuary in the Cathedral&mdash;the
Virgin, by Juan Martinez Montañez. Ford says, “This sweet and dignified
model was the favourite of his great pupil, Alonso Cano.” The choir was
severely injured by the collapse of the dome in 1888. The pillars and
baldachino are richly adorned with Gothic figures and stonework. The
fine gilt railing is the work of Sancho Muñoz (1519). But the chief
glory of the choir is its exquisitely carved stalls, 117 in number,
executed between 1475 and 1548, by Nufro Sanchez, Dancart, and Guillen.
Moorish influence may be traced in the patterns and the coloured inlaid
work of the chairbacks. The handsome lectern bespeaks the skill of
Bartolomé Morel. Till the collapse of the dome, the choir was the
repository of a number of priceless missals, illuminated in the
fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries. The organs are huge but
inartistic. As instruments, they are beyond all praise. The older,
dating from 1777, was built by Jorge Bosch, the other by Valentin
Verdalonga in 1817.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_79" id="page_79">{79}</a></span></p>

<p>“Between the choir and High Altar is put up during Holy Week the
exquisite bronze candlestick, 25 feet high, called El Tenebrario, one of
the finest specimens of bronze work of the sixteenth century that exists
(it may be seen in the Sacristy), and wrought, in 1562, by Morel; when
the <i>Miserere</i> is sung, it is lighted with thirteen candles, twelve of
which are put out one after another, indicating that the Apostles
deserted Christ; one alone of white wax is left burning, and is a symbol
of the Virgin, true to the last. At Easter, also, the Ciro Pascual or
fount candle, equal to a large marble pillar, 24 feet high, and weighing
seven or eight hundredweight of wax, is placed to the left of the High
Altar” (Ford).</p>

<p>Facing the choir stands the isolated Capilla Mayor, containing the High
Altar. It is enclosed on three sides by a railing of wrought iron, and
on the fourth by a superb Gothic retablo. Schmidt considers this work
the quintessence of late Gothic sculpture. The middle parts date from
the fifteenth, the outer from the sixteenth century. The ornamentation
is of extraordinary delicacy and richness. It is divided into forty-five
compartments, each containing subjects from the Scriptures and the lives
of the saints in sculpture painted and gilded. It is crowned by a
crucifix<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_80" id="page_80">{80}</a></span> and the statues of the Virgin and St John. This fine
altar-piece was begun by the Fleming Dancart in 1479, and was completed
by Spanish artists in 1526.</p>

<p>Behind the altar is the Sacristy, adorned with terra-cotta statues by
Miguel Florentin, Juan Marin, and others. Here is kept a reliquary
shaped like a triptych, presented to the church by Alfonso the Wise, and
called the Alphonsine Tables.</p>

<p>Behind the Capilla Mayor, at the eastern extremity of the nave, is the
Capilla Real (Royal Chapel). The building&mdash;which, as Ford remarks, is
almost a church by itself&mdash;was begun by Gainza in 1514, and finished in
1566 by his successors, Fernan Ruiz, Diaz de Palacios, and Maeda. The
chapel is of the Renaissance style, and has a lofty dome. There is a
handsome frieze showing the figures of children carrying shields and
lances. The chapel is divided by light pillars into seven compartments,
of which the midmost is occupied by the altar of the Virgin de los
Reyes. This image was the gift of St Louis of France to St Ferdinand.
“It is of great archæological interest,” says Ford; “it is made like a
movable lay-figure; the hair is of spun gold, and the shoes are like
those used in the thirteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_81" id="page_81">{81}</a></span> century, ornamented with the lilies of
France and the word “Amor.” In 1873, the fine gold crown belonging to
this image [a sixteenth-century work] was stolen. This image is seated
on a silver throne, thirteenth-century work, embossed with the arms of
Castile and Leon.” The body of St Ferdinand, remarkably well preserved,
is contained in a silver urn, placed on the original sepulchre, which is
engraved with epitaphs in Latin, Spanish, Hebrew, and Arabic. In the
vault beneath is the ivory figure of the Virgin de las Batallas, which
the king always carried with him on his campaigns. It is a fine piece of
Gothic statuary. Ferdinand’s sword is also preserved in this chapel.
Here are the tombs of Alfonso el Sabio, of Beatriz of Swabia, his
mother, of Pedro I., Maria de Padilla, and various Infantes. An
interesting trophy is the flag of the Polish Legion of the French army,
taken by the Spaniards at Bailen. The twelve statues in the entrance to
the Capilla Real are after the designs of Peter Kempener; there is a
Mater Dolorosa by Murillo in the sacristy. Some of the later work in
this chapel exhibits those fantastic and grotesque features which became
common, under the name of <i>Estilo Monstruoso</i>, in Seville.</p>

<p>The entrance to this chapel is flanked by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_82" id="page_82">{82}</a></span> Capillas de San Pedro and
de la Concepcion Grande. In the south aisle is the chapel of the
Purification or of the Marshal, containing a remarkable altar-piece by
Peter Kempener&mdash;exhibiting the portraits of the founder, Marshal Pedro
Caballero, and his family. Adjacent is the Sala Capitular, in fine
Renaissance style, the work of Gainza and Diego de Riaño (1531). The
roof is formed by a fine cupola, supported by Ionic columns, beneath
which is some admirable plateresco work, with escutcheons, triglyphs,
etc. The hall contains a portrait of St Ferdinand by Francisco Pacheco,
the “Conception” and ovals by Murillo, and the “Four Virtues” by Pablo
de Céspedes. Beneath the windows are seen reliefs by Velasco, Cabrera,
and Vazquez.</p>

<p>The sacristy (Sacristia Mayor) is in the Renaissance style, and lies
south of the Sala Capitular. It was built by Gainza in 1535, after
designs by Riaño, who had died two years earlier. One of the three
altars against the southern wall is adorned by the beautiful “Descent
from the Cross” by Peter Kempener (a native of Brussels, called by the
Spaniards Campaña), before which Murillo used to stand for hours in rapt
contemplation. This priceless work of art was cut in five pieces by the
French, with a view to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_83" id="page_83">{83}</a></span> removal, and has not been very well
restored. The sacristy contains also three interesting paintings, dating
from the early sixteenth century, by Alejo Fernandez; and the “San
Leandro” and “San Isidore” of Murillo.</p>

<p>In this chamber is kept the treasury of the Cathedral. In it might be
included the superb silver monstrance by Juan de Arfe (1580-87). It is
twelve feet high, and richly adorned with columns, reliefs, and
statuettes. The treasury likewise contains another monstrance, studded
with 1200 jewels; a rock-crystal cup, said to have belonged to St
Ferdinand; and the keys presented to that sovereign on the surrender of
the city. That given by the Jews is of iron gilt, with the words,
<i>Melech hammelakim giphthohh Melek kolhaaretz gabo</i> (the King of kings
will open, the King of all the earth will enter); the other key is of
silver gilt and was surrendered by Sakkáf. The inscription upon it is in
Arabic, and reads, <i>May Allah render eternal the dominion of Islam in
this city</i>.</p>

<p>Proceeding along the south aisle, towards the main entrance, we first
reach the Capilla de San Andrés, the burying-place of the ancient family
of Guzman. Behind the chapel of Nuestra Señora de las Dolores is the
fine Sacristia de los Calices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_84" id="page_84">{84}</a></span> It is the work of those who built the
Sacristia Mayor. It contains several fine paintings&mdash;the Saints Justa
and Rufina (patrons of Seville) by Goya (among his finest works), the
“Angel de la Guarda” and the “St Dorothy” of Murillo, the “Death of a
Saint” by Zurbarán, the “Trinity of Theotocopuli” (El Greco), a triptych
by Morales, and “The Death of the Virgin”&mdash;an old German picture. This
crucifix over the altar is one of the most admirable productions of
Montañez.</p>

<p>The next chapel (de la Santa Cruz) is adorned by a fine “Descent from
the Cross” by Fernandez de Guadelupe (1527). The Puerta de la Lonja has
a fresco, painted in 1584, of “St Christopher carrying the Infant Jesus
across a River.” A representation of this saint is to be found in nearly
all Spanish cathedrals, owing to a curious superstition that to look
upon it secures the beholder for the rest of that day from an evil
death. This fresco, which measures thirty-two feet high, is opposite the
“Capilla de la Gamba” (or, of the leg&mdash;of Adam). Here we find “La
Generacion”&mdash;Luis de Vargas’s masterpiece. “The picture,” says Herr
Schmidt, “is wholly in the Italian style, and one of the best examples
of this phase of the Spanish Renaissance.”</p>

<p>The large chapel of the Antigua contains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_85" id="page_85">{85}</a></span> fine tomb of Archbishop
Mendoza, by Miguel Florentin, erected in 1509. Here is also a very
ancient mural painting, after the Byzantine style, of the “Madonna and
Child,” which was placed here in 1578, and is of unknown and rather
mysterious origin. The retablo is distinguished by marble statues in the
baroque style by Pedro Duque Cornejo. The small sacristy behind this
chapel contains pictures by Zurbarán, Morales, and others.</p>

<p>The Capilla de San Hermenegildo has a good statue of the saint by
Montañez, and a fine sepulchral monument to Archbishop Juan de Cervantes
(1453), by Lorenzo Mercadante de Bretaña, the master of Nufro Sanchez.
The Capilla de San José contains “The Espousals of the Virgin” by Valdés
Leal, a “Nativity of Christ” by Antolinez, and an inferior retablo (“The
Massacre of the Innocents”). The Capilla de Santa Ana possesses a Gothic
retablo, dating from about 1450, and divided into fourteen sections. It
comes from the old Mosque-Cathedral. The lower part of the work,
illustrating the life of St Anne, dates from 1504, the artists having
been Hernandez and Barbara Marmolejo. From beneath the tribune a
staircase leads to the Archives, which escaped demolition at the hands
of the French, through having been sent to Cadiz. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span> last chapel in
the south aisle (San Laureano) is dedicated to a saint, who, like St
Denis of France, having been decapitated, performed the unusual feat of
walking away with his head under his arm. Here is the tomb of Archbishop
de Ejea, who died in 1417.</p>

<p>On the west side of the Cathedral are five small chapels. The Nacimiento
chapel contains an admirable “Nativity with the Four Evangelists” by
Luis de Vargas, and a “Virgin and St Anne” by Morales. To the right of
the Puerta Mayor is the altar of Nuestra Señora del Consuelo, with a
“Holy Family,” the masterpiece of Alonso Miguel de Tobar (1678-1738),
esteemed the ablest of Murillo’s pupils. Facing this is the little altar
of Santo Angel, with a “Guardian Angel” by Murillo. The altar of the
Visitation has a good retablo by Pedro Villegas de Marmolejo
(1502-1569), and a statue of St Jerome by his namesake, Geronimo
Hernandez.</p>

<p>Near the north-western corner of the church the Puerta del Sagrario
leads into the Sagrario or Parish Church. This was built between 1618
and 1662 in the Baroque style by Miguel Zumarraga and Fernandez de
Iglesias. The width of the single arch of which the roof consists is
believed to endanger the safety of the edifice. The rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span> statues that
adorn the interior are by Dayne and Jose de Arce. There is a notable
retablo by Pedro Roldan which came from a Franciscan convent now
suppressed. The wall of the sacristy is faced with beautiful <i>azulejos</i>
of the Arabian period, and in one of the side-chapels is a noteworthy
statue of the Virgin by Montañez. In the vault beneath this impressive
church the Archbishops of Seville are buried.</p>

<p>Returning to the Cathedral, we find on the left the Capilla del
Bautisterio or of San Antonio. It is famous for one of Murillo’s finest
works, “St Anthony of Padua’s Vision of the Child Jesus.” This is the
picture which was stolen in 1874, conveyed to New York, sold to a Mr
Schaus for £50, and by him returned to the ecclesiastical authorities.
This chapel is also remarkable for its <i>pila</i> or font, the work of
Antonio Florentin, and Giralda windows. Next to it is the Capilla de las
Escalas, with two pictures by Luca Giordano, “strong in character,
drawing, and colour,” and the sepulchre of Bishop Baltasar del Rio
(about 1500); then comes the Capilla de Santiago, with paintings by
Valdés Leal and Juan de las Roelas, a stained-glass window with the
richest tones, and the tomb of Archbishop Gonzalo de Mena (1401); and
the Capilla de San Francisco, with another fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> window, and an
ambitious “Apotheosis of St Francis” by Herrera el Mozo.</p>

<p>Separated from this chapel by the Puerta de los Naranjos is the Capilla
de la Visitacion (or Doncellas). The Puerta is furnished with two
altars, one, the Altar de la Asunción, the other, the Virgen de Belén.
The former has a painting by Carlo Maratta, the latter a “Virgin and
Child” by Alonso Cano. The Capilla de los Evangelistas has an
altar-piece in nine parts by Hernando de Sturmio (1555), which shows us
the Giralda as it was before the present upper part had been added.
Crossing before the Puerta Lagarto we reach the little chapel of Nuestra
Señora del Pilar, with a notable “Madonna and Child” by Pedro Millan.
The altar-piece of the Capilla de San Pedro, between this chapel and the
Capilla Real, has paintings by Zurbarán, hardly distinguishable in the
dim light. On the other side of the Capilla Real is the Chapel of la
Concepcion Grande, containing pictures relating to the Immaculate
Conception, and a crucifix attributed to Alonso Cano. Here is also a
fine modern monument to Cardinal Cienfuegos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Close</span> to the Church of San Marcos is the Convent of Santa Paula with a
chapel dating from about 1475. The house, which is of the religious of
St Augustine, was founded by Doña Ana de Santillan and the Portuguese
Donha Isabel Henriquez, Marqueza de Montemayor. This illustrious lady
and her consort, Dom João, Constable of Portugal, are entombed in the
Capilla Mayor in separate niches. The portal of this church is one of
the richest in Europe. It is magnificently decorated with white and blue
<i>azulejos</i>, over the arch being seven medallions representing the birth
of Christ and the life of St Paul, encircled with garlands of flowers
and fruit, and the figures white on a blue ground. In the tympanum of
the arch are displayed the Arms of Spain in white marble on a field of
blue tiles, supported by an eagle, and flanked by the escutcheons of the
Catholic sovereigns. The <i>azulejo</i> work was jointly executed by
Francesco Niculoso of Pisa and Pedro Millan. The interior of the church
is in the six<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span>teenth-century style, and, except for the tombs of the
Marqueses de Montemayor, not specially interesting.</p>

<p>In 1472 Maese Rodrigo founded a college, which afterwards became the
seat of the University of Seville, and is now a seminary. Attached to it
is a chapel built in the first years of the sixteenth century. It is a
fine example of the late Gothic style. The retablo exhibits good
painting and carving by unknown artists. The front of the altar displays
fine specimens of Andalusian ceramic art. “The students of the
seminary,” says Ford, “wear a scarf of brilliant scarlet upon a black
gown.”</p>

<p>The most important monument of this period in Seville is the Casa
Pilatos. It illustrates the fusion of the Moorish and Renaissance
styles, almost to the effacement of the former. In the architecture of
this period we usually find an Arabic groundwork nearly obscured by
ornamentation of the newer style. In the schemes of decoration the
conventional floral designs and geometrical patterns remain, while the
inscriptions, which figured so largely in earlier work, disappear. The
stucco and <i>azulejos</i> no longer cover the whole walls, and the windows
and doors become larger and less graceful. As Herr<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span> Schmidt remarks,
effect was no longer sought for in the innately elegant but in bold,
monumental compositions.</p>

<p>Mr Digby Wyatt (“An Architect’s Note-Book in Spain”) indicates as the
two special points of architectural value possessed by the Casa de
Pilatos, “the entirely moresque character of the stucco-work at a
comparatively late date, and the profuse use of <i>azulejos</i> or coloured
tiles. It is ... in and about the splendid staircase that this charming
tile lining, of the use of which we have here of very late years
commenced a very satisfactory revival, asserts its value as a beautiful
mode of introducing clean and permanent polychromatic decoration.”</p>

<p>The history of this beautiful building is of singular interest. Its
erection was begun in 1500 by the <i>adelantado</i> (governor), Don Per
Enriquez, continued by his son, Don Fadrique Enriquez de Ribera, first
Marqués de Tarifa, after his return from a two years’ pilgrimage in the
Holy Land, and finished by Don Per Afan, first Duque de Alcalá, and
sometime Viceroy of Naples, in 1533. Authorities differ whether it
received its name from its having been modelled on the House of Pilate,
seen by Don Fadrique, or from the relics presented to the Duque de
Alcalá by Pope Pius V. The ex-Viceroy was a liberal patron of the arts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92">{92}</a></span>
He enriched his house with priceless works of art and a fine
library&mdash;since removed to Madrid. He played the part of Mæcenas to the
Varros of his generation. Here the wits, the savants, and the virtuosi
of Spain were made welcome, and here they met together in a noble
coterie. Among the frequenters of the house may be named Pacheco the
painter, Céspedes, the Herreras, Góngora the poet, Jauregui, Baltasar de
Alcazár, Rioja, Juan de Arguizo, and (probably) Cervantes. Herr Schmidt
tells us that Seville did not stand alone among the cities of Spain in
boasting such a rallying-point for genius: “In Guadalajara, the palace
of the Mendozas, in Alba de Tormes and Abadia, the castles of the Duque
de Alba, in Madrid, the arts were treasured by Antonio Perez; in
Zaragoza by the Duque de Villahermosa, in Plasencia by Don Luis de
Avila, in Burgos by the Velascos. These and other families in Spain
followed the example set by the Medici in Italy.”</p>

<p>The ground-plan of the Casa de Pilatos is Moorish, with an inner court,
two storeys, guest-chambers, and high outer walls surrounding a garden.
The exterior is plain and dignified. The portal is of marble, and over
the arch is the text, “Nisi Dominus ædificaverit domum, in vanum
laboraverunt qui ædificant eam,” etc. To the left<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> of the door is a
jasper cross fixed in the wall. In October 1521, the Marqués de Tarifa
returned from the Holy Land, and having traversed the path trodden by
Christ on His way from Pilate’s house to Calvary, he placed this cross
on the wall and counted thence the fourteen stations of the cross. The
last fortuitously coincided with the Cruz del Campo, raised near the
Caños de Carmona, in the year 1482.</p>

<p>The central <i>patio</i> is markedly Moorish in character, and is encircled
with arcades of extraordinary symmetry and beauty. Pedro de Madrazo
calls attention to the harmonious variety and irregularity of the arches
and windows, comparing the effect thus produced to the admired disorder
of the forest and plantation. The decoration of the walls and arches
bears a general resemblance to that of the Alcazar, but on closer
examination the influence of the plateresco, Late Gothic, and
Renaissance styles is revealed. The fountain in the middle of the
<i>patio</i> is adorned with dolphins and four huge statues belonging to the
best period of Roman art. The chapel is in the mixed pointed and Moorish
styles. In the vestibule the <i>ajaraca</i>, or trellis-work, the <i>azulejos</i>,
and the <i>ajimeces</i>, or twin-windows (now converted into ordinary
windows) recall Moorish art; while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span> ceiling is in the plateresco
style. The arch of the chapel is Gothic, and its walls are laid with
<i>azulejos</i> and stucco. In the middle of the floor stands a short marble
column, a copy of the pillar at which Christ is supposed to have been
scourged, preserved at Rome; it was the gift of Pius V.</p>

<p>The room called the Prætorium has a fine coffered ceiling and good
tiling. The staircase is magnificent. Its walls are faced with
<i>azulejos</i>, and its ceiling is in the cupola or half-orange style of the
Salón de los Embajadores. Another room on the upper floor is adorned
with paintings by Pacheco, the subject being Dædalus and Icarus. The
view from the roof is perhaps the finest in the city.</p>

<p>The Casa de Pilatos, as might be inferred from the character of its
founder, is a veritable cabinet of antiques and precious objects,
marbles and fragments from Italica figuring largely in the collection.</p>

<p>A notable private residence, dating probably in its foundations from the
beginning of the fifteenth century, is the Casa de Abades, sometimes
called the Casa de los Pinelos. It passed into the hands of the Genoese
family from which it derives its second name, and thence to the
Cathedral Chapter (composed of <i>abbés</i> or <i>abades</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> In the sixteenth
century it became the property of the Ribera family, the owners of the
Casa de Pilatos. It is described by Madrazo as presenting a fine example
of the Sevillian Renaissance style, which would appear to be compounded
of all pre-existing styles. Mr Digby Wyatt, on the other hand, thinks
the house more Italian than Spanish. But the beautiful <i>patio</i>, the
dados of <i>azulejos</i>, and the <i>ajimeces</i> looking on the courtyard are
distinctly Andalusian features. There are also traces of Moorish
geometrical ornamentation, covered with repeated coats of whitewash.</p>

<p>The Palacio de las Dueñas, more properly the Palace of the Dukes of
Alba, and sometimes called Palacio de las Pinedas, is a vast and once
splendid mansion, partaking of the mixed style of the two buildings last
described. It boasted at one time eleven <i>patios</i>, with nine fountains,
and over one hundred marble columns. A fine <i>patio</i> remains, surrounded
by a gallery with graceful columns. The staircase, with its vaulted
roof, recalls that of the Casa de Pilatos. In the lower part is a chapel
of the fifteenth century, which has fared very badly at the hands of
restorers or rather demolishers. This palace was for a time the
residence of Lord Holland, an ardent admirer of Spanish literature, and
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span> author (1805) of a memoir on Lope de Vega and Guillen de Castro.</p>

<p>Other notable residences of the nobility in Seville are the Casa de
Bustos Tavera, and the Palaces of the Dukes of Osuna and Palomares and
the Count of Peñaflor. These all date from what may be loosely called
Mudejar times.</p>

<p>The Church of the University of Seville is of interest. The university
itself was originally a college of the Society of Jesus, and was built
in the middle of the sixteenth century, after designs ascribed to
Herrera. Madrazo thinks it more likely that these were the work of the
Jesuit Bartolomé de Bustamante. The church forms a Latin cross, a
spacious half-orange dome covering the transept. The Renaissance style
is followed. Here repose the members of the illustrious Ribera family,
their remains having been transported hither on the suppression of the
Cartuja (Carthusian Monastery). The oldest of the tombs is also that of
the oldest Ribera, who died in 1423, aged 105 years. The finest is that
of Doña Catalina (died 1505), the work of a Genoese sculptor. Other
tombs are those of Don Pedro Henriquez, Diego Gomez de Ribera, Don
Perafan de Ribera (1455), and Beatriz Portocarrero (1458). Let into the
pavement is<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span> a magnificent bronze slab, to the memory of the Duque de
Alcalá, the owner of the Casa de Pilatos. Among the sepulchres are those
of the founder, Lorenzo Suarez de Figueroa, whose favourite dog is
sculptured at his feet, and Benito Arias Montano, a <i>savant</i> who died in
1598. Over the altar are three paintings: the “Holy Family,” the
“Adoration of the Magi,” and the “Nativity”; the first by Roelas, the
other two by his pupil, Juan de Varela. These, especially the first, are
among the finest pictures in the city. The statue of St Ignatius Loyola
by Montañez, coloured by Pacheco, is probably the only faithful likeness
of the Saint. In this church are also to be seen two admirable works of
Alonso Cano, “St John the Baptist” and “St John the Divine.”</p>

<p>The Renaissance made itself felt in Spain during the reign of Charles
V., and was productive of the plateresco style. Seville contains two
imposing monuments of this type of architecture&mdash;the Ayuntamiento (Town
Hall) and Lonja (Exchange). The first-named was begun in 1527 by Diego
de Riaño, and completed under Felipe II., about forty years later.
Madrazo considers the building “somewhat inharmonious through the
variety, a little excessive, of its lines, but admirable for the
richness of the decoration and for fine and delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> execution&mdash;a merit
of the first importance in structures of this style, where the sculptor
or stone-cutter ranked with the architect.”</p>

<p>The lower and older storey has three façades, all elaborately chased and
designed like silversmiths’ work. The central façade, facing the Calle
de Génova, bears the statues of Saints Ferdinand, Leandro, and
Isidoro&mdash;symbolical of the temporal and spiritual power. The right
façade is the purest and most regular of the three. The upper storey,
belonging to the reign of Felipe II., appears almost plain in comparison
with the tower. In the vestibule is a noble Latin inscription relating
to justice. The lower Sala Capitular is a magnificent apartment worthy,
as Madrazo remarks, of the Senate of a great republic. It is adorned
with the statues of the Castilian kings down to Charles V., with a rich
frieze designed with genii, masks, and animals, and with appropriate
legends. The upper Sala Capitular has a magnificent <i>artesonado</i>
ceiling. Over the grand staircase are a fine coffered ceiling and
another in the form of a cupola. The archives of the municipality
contain several valuable historical documents, and the embroidered
banner of St Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The Lonja or Exchange dates from Felipe II.’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_99" id="page_99">{99}</a></span> reign. The Patio de los
Naranjos was formerly frequented by the merchants and brokers of Seville
for the transaction of business, and this practice interfering seriously
with divine worship in the Cathedral, the Archbishop, Cristobal de
Rojas, petitioned Felipe II. to follow the precedent just established by
Sir Thomas Gresham and to build an Exchange or Casa de Contratacion. The
preparation of the plans was confided to Herrera, and the building,
under the direction of Juan de Minjares, was finished in 1598&mdash;at
precisely the time, as Ford remarks, that the commerce of Seville began
to decline. The Lonja in its stern simplicity reflects, like the
Escorial, the temper of Felipe II.&mdash;a sovereign, unpopular though he may
have been, in whom it is impossible not to recognise the elements of
greatness. The edifice forms a perfectly regular quadrangle, and the
sobriety of the decoration affords a striking contrast to the gorgeous
profusion of the Ayuntamiento. The inner court is noble and severe with
its gallery of Doric and Ionic columns. The dignity of the whole has
been impaired by later additions and restorations. Here are deposited
the archives of the Indies (<i>i.e.</i> South America), the documents being
arranged in handsome mahogany cases. They have never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span> thoroughly
gone through and examined. The business men of Seville soon abandoned
their Exchange, and it is chiefly to be remembered as the seat of
Murillo’s Academy of Painters, founded in 1660.</p>

<p>In connection with the American traffic of Seville it should be
mentioned that in the village of Castilleja la Cuesta, near the city, is
the house where Hernando Cortés died in 1547. The place has been
acquired by the Duc de Montpensier, by whom it has been converted into a
sort of museum. The Conquistador’s bones rest in the country which, with
such intrepidity, he won for the Spanish race.</p>

<p>The Civil Hospital of Seville, otherwise known by the ghastly
designation of the Hospital de las Cinco Llagas or del Sangre (of the
Five Wounds or of the Blood), was designed in 1540 by Martin Gainza. It
is a massive stone edifice of two storeys, the lower Doric and the upper
Ionic. In the central <i>patio</i> is the chapel in the form of a Greek
cross, the façade exhibiting a tasteful combination of the three Grecian
styles. The altarpiece is by Maeda and Alonzo Vazquez. The pictures of
saints are by Zurbarán, and the “Apotheosis of St Hermenegild” and the
“Descent from the Cross” by Roelas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="BUILDINGS_OF_THE_SEVENTEENTH_AND_EIGHTEENTH_CENTURIES" id="BUILDINGS_OF_THE_SEVENTEENTH_AND_EIGHTEENTH_CENTURIES"></a>BUILDINGS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES</h2>


<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">About</span> the middle of the seventeenth century there lived at Seville a
young gallant, Don Miguel de Mañara by name, whose excesses and
escapades horrified even that lax generation. Marriage with the heiress
of the Mendozas did not sober him. Of him, at this period of his life,
this much good may be said, that he patronised and encouraged Murillo.
But one day something happened: quite suddenly the rake changed into a
devotee, an ascetic&mdash;a saint in the seventeenth-century acceptation of
the word. The wine-bibber forswore even chocolate as too tempting a
beverage.</p>

<p>What had happened to produce this startling reformation? Accounts vary.
Some say that Don Miguel, traversing the streets in insensate rage
against some custom-house officials, was suddenly and vividly made
conscious of the enormous wickedness of his life. A more picturesque
version is the following: Returning from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span> a carousal one night, the Don
found himself absolutely unable to discover his house or the way
thither. Wandering desperately up and down distressed, and in perplexity
of mind, he perceived a funeral cortège approaching. Impelled by
irresistible curiosity, he stepped up to the bearers of the bier and
asked whose body they were carrying. Came the reply: “The corpse of Don
Miguel de Mañara.” The horror-stricken prodigal tore aside the pall, and
lo! the face of the dead man was his own. The vision disappeared, and
the same instant the Don found himself at the door of his own house. He
entered it a changed man.</p>

<p>The church and hospital of La Caridad are the existing fruits of Don
Miguel’s conversion. As far back as 1578, there had existed at Seville a
confraternity, the objects of which were to assist condemned criminals
at their last moments and to provide them with Christian burial. To this
association the reformed rake turned his attention. He converted the
chapel into a hospital for the sick, the poor, and the pilgrims of all
nations, and liberally endowed it out of his ample resources.</p>

<p>The edifice is in the decadent Greco-Roman style, and was designed by
Bernardo Simón de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103">{103}</a></span> Pereda. The Baroque façade is adorned with five large
blue faïence designs on a white ground, the subjects being Faith, Hope,
and Charity, St James, and St George. Tradition has it that these were
made after drawings by Murillo at the <i>azulejo</i> factory of Triana. The
church hardly appears to us to warrant the description “one of the most
elegant in Seville,” applied to it by Sir W. Stirling-Maxwell. Under the
High Altar is buried the founder, Don Miguel. His own wish was to be
buried at the entrance to the church, with the epitaph: <i>Aqui yacen los
huesos y cenizas del peor hombre que ha habido en el mundo</i> (Here lie
the bones and ashes of the worst man that ever lived in this world). His
sword, and his portrait painted by Valdés Leal, are preserved in the
Hospital.</p>

<p>As a museum of Spanish art, La Caridad possesses great importance. The
altarpiece, “The Descent from the Cross,” is the masterpiece of Pedro
Roldan. The two paintings near the entrance by Juan de Valdés Leal
(1630-1691) are regarded by Herr Schmidt as entitling that artist to
rank as one of the greatest masters of realism of any age. This opinion
is not shared by a recent writer (C. Gasquoine Hartley), who considers
the pictures theatrical, though the exe<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span>cution exhibits a certain power.
“In one of them a hand holds a pair of scales, in which the sins of the
world&mdash;represented by bats, peacocks, serpents, and other objects&mdash;are
weighed against the emblems of Christ’s Passion; in the other, which is
the finer composition, Death, with a coffin under one arm, is about to
extinguish a taper, which lights a table spread with crowns, jewels, and
all the gewgaws of earthly pomp. The words ‘In Ictu Oculi’ circle the
gleaming light of the taper, while upon the ground rests an open coffin,
dimly revealing the corpse within.” Murillo said this picture had to be
looked at with the nostrils closed. For the two paintings Valdés
received 5740 reals.</p>

<p>Of the eleven pictures painted by Murillo for this church, only six
remain, the others having been carried off by the French. The subjects
are “Moses striking the Rock,” the “Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes,”
the “Charity of San Juan de Dios,” the “Annunciation,” the “Infant
Jesus,” and “St John.” The first picture, depicting, as it does, the
terrible thirst experienced by the Israelites, is known as <i>La Sed</i>
(Thirst). Some critics think this is one of the finest of the master’s
productions. As is usual in his compositions, the figures are all those
of ordinary Sevillian types.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span> “The personality of Christ in the ‘Miracle
of the Loaves and Fishes,’<span class="lftspc">”</span> says C. Gasquoine Hartley, “lacks the force
of the ancient prophet, and the work as a whole is inferior to its
companion picture.” The “Charity of San Juan de Dios”&mdash;representing the
Saint carrying a beggar with the help of an angel&mdash;is the best and most
characteristic of the six paintings. The “Infant Jesus” and the “St
John” are also very fine. For the “San Juan de Dios” and the “St
Elizabeth of Hungary”&mdash;<i>El Tiñoso</i>&mdash;(now at Madrid) together, Murillo
was paid 18,840 reals; for the Moses, 13,300 reals; and for the “Miracle
of the Loaves and Fishes,” 15,973 reals.</p>

<p>The last building which may be said to rank as an architectural monument
erected in Seville is the Palacio de San Telmo, now the residence of the
Duc de Montpensier. In the year 1682 the Naval School of San Telmo was
founded on the site of the former palace of the Bishops of Morocco and
the tribunal of the Holy Office. The present edifice, begun, after plans
by Antonio Rodriguez, in 1734, was not completed till 1796. The palace
adjoins the beautiful gardens of the Delicias. The façade is exceedingly
ornate, the decoration being in the Plateresco style. The general effect
is pleasing, but critics have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> unsparing in their denunciations of
the structure. It certainly reflects the debasing influence of the
architect Jose Churriguera (1665-1725), who has given his name
(<i>Churrigueresque</i>) to one of the most tawdry and tasteless styles of
architecture.</p>

<p>The Archiepiscopal Palace, adjacent to the Cathedral, is also in the bad
style of the later seventeenth century. The interior, however, is worth
visiting for the sake of the noble marble staircase, one of the finest
in the city. Here are three paintings by Alejo Fernandez, an early
seventeenth-century artist, whom Lord Leighton considered “the most
conspicuous among the Gothic painters.”</p>

<p>The Fabrica de Tabacos is a vast building completed in 1757. Apart from
its size, it possesses no architectural interest, and though a favourite
showplace for tourists, does not come within the scope of a work of this
character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107">{107}</a></span></p>

<p class="c"><span class="smcap">Albert F. Calvert and C. Gasquoine Hartley</span></p>


<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">In</span> Seville, perhaps to a greater extent than in any city, even in Spain,
the country of passionate individualism, art is the reflection of the
life and temper of the people; and to understand Seville we must know
her painters. As we look at the pictures of the Spanish primitives, at
the emphatic canvases of Juan de las Roelas and Herrera, for instance;
at the realism of Zubarán, or, still more, at the ecstatic visions of
Murillo&mdash;as we see them in the old Convento de la Merced, now the Museo
Provincial, in the Cathedral, or in one or another of the numerous
churches in the city, we find the special spirit of Andalusia.</p>

<p>There is one quality that, at a first glance, impresses us in these
pictures, so different, and yet all having one aim. It is their profound
seriousness. Rarely, indeed, shall we find a picture in which the idea
of beauty, whether it is the beauty of colour or the beauty of form, has
stood first in the painter’s mind; almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108">{108}</a></span> in vain shall we search for
any love of landscape, for any passage introduced just for its own sake.
For, let it be remembered, in Andalusia art was devotional always. “The
chief end of art,” says Pacheco, the master of Velazquez, in his <i>Arte
de la Pintura</i>, “is to persuade men to piety and to incline them to
God.” Pictures had other purposes to serve than that of beauty. They
were painted for the Church to enforce its lessons, they were used as
warnings, and as a means of recording the lives of the Saints. In other
countries, it is true, painters have spent their strength in religious
art, but almost always we can find as well as the sacred, some outside
motive, some human love of the subject for itself&mdash;for its opportunities
of beauty. The intense realism of these Spanish pictures is a thing
apart; these Assumptions, Martyrdoms, and Saintly Legends were painted
with a vivid sense of the reality of these things by men who felt upon
them the hand of God. We know that Luis de Vargas daily humbled himself
by scourging and by wearing a hair shirt, and Juan Juanes prepared
himself for a new picture by communion and confession. These are two
examples chosen out of many. A legend we read of Don Miguel de Mañara,
the founder of the Hospital of La<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109">{109}</a></span> Caridad, illustrates this dramatic
religious sense of Spain. One day in church Don Miguel saw a beautiful
nun, and, forgetful of her habit, made amorous proposals. She did not
speak; instead, she turned to look at him; whereupon he saw the side of
her face which had been hidden from his eyes: it was eaten away,
corrupted by a hideous disease, so that it seemed more horrible than the
face of death. It was such scenes as this that the Spanish artists chose
to paint. But, indeed, it would be tedious to enumerate the examples
which Spain offers of this curious, often, it would seem to us,
corrupted sense of the gloom of life, carrying with it as one result the
passionate responsibility of art. Always, we feel certain that the
Spanish painters felt all that they express.</p>

<p>And this overpowering, if mistaken, understanding of the presence of the
divine life gave a profound seriousness to human life. The shadow of
earth was felt, not its light; and emotion expressed itself in an
intense seriousness, that is over-emphatic too often&mdash;always, in fact,
when the painter’s idea is not centred in reality. This is the reason
why a Spanish painter had to treat a vision as a real scene. We have
pictures horrible with the sense of human corruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110">{110}</a></span>&mdash;such, for
instance, are the two gruesome canvases of Valdés Leal, in La Caridad.
Again and again is enforced the Catholic lesson of humility, expressing
itself in acts of charity to the poor, so essential an idea when this
life is held as but a threshold to a divine life. We find a sort of wild
delight in martyrdom; a joy that is perfectly sincere in the scourging
of the body. All the Spanish pictures tell stories. Was not their aim to
translate life?&mdash;the life of earth and the, to them, truer life of
heaven&mdash;and life itself is a story? Their successes in art are due to
this, their failures to the sacrifice of all endeavours to this aim; a
danger from which, perhaps, no painter except Velazquez quite escaped.
He, faultless in balance, in his exquisite statement of life, expresses
perfectly the truth his predecessors had tried for, but missed, except
indeed now and again, in some unusual triumph over themselves. We find
hardly a painter able to free himself from the traditions of his
subject. Only Velazquez, controlled by the northern strain that mingles
with the passion of his Andalusian temper, was saved quite from this
danger of over-statement. And Velazquez does not belong to Seville,
though he was born in the southern city on June 5, 1599, in the house,
No. 8, Calle de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111">{111}</a></span> Gorgoja; though the first years of his life were spent
there, the time of childhood, the few months of work with the violent
Herrera, the five years in the studio of Pacheco, his master; though&mdash;a
fact of greater import&mdash;his temper was Andalusian; and though his early
pictures&mdash;the <i>bodégones</i>, so familiar to us in England, whither so many
have travelled through the fortune of wars&mdash;are entirely Spanish in
their direct realism. Velazquez worked contemporaneously with the
Realistic movement that quickened the arts in Seville in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, but he worked outside it. This explains the
silence of his art in Seville. Of the pictures of his youth, painted
while he was there, none remain, except one in the Archiepiscopal
Palace, “The Virgin delivering the Chasuble to San Ildefonso”; and the
authenticity of this picture has been denied until very recently, a fact
explained by the bad condition of the canvas. To see the wonderful art
of Velazquez you must leave Seville and visit the Museo del Prado at
Madrid. Seville is the home of religious art. The habit of her painters
was serious; in their profound religious sense, in their adherence,
almost brutal at times, to facts, as well as in those interludes of
sensuous sweetness that now<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112">{112}</a></span> and again, as, for instance in the art of
Murillo, burst out so strangely like an exotic bloom, they reflect the
temper of Spain. It is contended sometimes that these pictures in
Seville are wanting in dignity, wanting in beauty. But are we not too
apt to confine beauty to certain forms of accepted expression? Surely
any art that has life; has dignity, has beauty; and no one can deny that
life was the inspiration of the Andalusian painters.</p>

<p>We must remember these things if we would understand the pictures in
Seville.</p>

<p>But first we find ourselves carried away from the reality and darkness
of life back to a happy childhood of art, as we look at the three
fourteenth-century frescoes of the Virgin&mdash;the “Antigua,” in the chapel
named after it in the Cathedral, “Nuestra Señora del Corral” in San
Ildefonso, and “Señora Maria de Rocamador” in San Lorenzo&mdash;an art when
the painter, less conscious of life and of himself, was content to paint
beautiful patterns. In these three pictures&mdash;all that are left to us&mdash;we
see the last of Byzantine art in Spain. The figures, with long oval
faces all of one type, are placed stiffly against a background of Gothic
gold. Look at “Señora Maria de Rocamador,” as she sits holding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113">{113}</a></span>
Child upon her knees; while two little angels kneel, one upon the left,
one on the right. She wears a blue robe, partly covered with a mantle of
deep purple, very beautiful with ornaments of gold and bordered with
gold braid. A bent coronet around her head stands out against the
glowing halo; the background is all of gold woven into a delicate
pattern. It is a picture of pure convention in which is no effort to
carry the mind beyond what is actually seen; it makes its appeal just as
so much decoration. This fresco, as well as the “Antigua” and “Nuestra
Señora del Corral,” have been much repainted&mdash;the ill-fortune of so many
early Spanish works.</p>

<p>But, in the fifteenth century, a new spirit came into art; and with the
work of Juan Sánchez de Castro the school of Seville may be said to
begin. No knowledge has come down to us of his life; we know only that
he was painting in Seville between 1454 and 1516. In his great fresco of
“San Cristóbal,” that covers the wall near to the main door in the old
Church of San Julian&mdash;alas! now spoiled by re-painting and by the
subsequent rotting away of the plaster&mdash;we find a different, human,
almost playful treatment of a sacred story. And for the first time in
Seville, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114">{114}</a></span>we see the special Spanish quality, characteristic of the
whole school from this time to the time of Goya, of rendering a scene
just as the painter supposed it might have happened. “A child’s dream of
a picture,” Mr Arthur Symons has called it. San Cristóbal, many times
the size of life, stretching from floor to ceiling, fills the whole
picture; he leans upon a pine-staff as he supports the Child Christ upon
his shoulders, who holds in his hands a globe of the world upon which
the shadow of a cross has fallen. The other figures, the hermit and two
pilgrims with staves and cloaks, are quite small; they reach just to the
Saint’s knees. And this immense grotesque figure is painted in all
seriousness, as a child might picture such a scene. To understand the
sincerity of the Spanish painter, we must compare his work with that
other fresco of “San Cristóbal,” painted, much later, by Perez de
Alesio, which is in the Cathedral. The Italian picture is an attempt to
illustrate a popular miracle, perfectly unconvincing; De Castro’s Saint
compels us to accept and realise what the painter himself believed in.
This is the difference between them.</p>

<p>In the smaller pictures of Sánchez de Castro that remain to us, such,
for instance, as the panel of the “Madonna with St Peter and St
Jerome,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115">{115}</a></span> once in San Julian, but now in the Cathedral, we find him more
bound by convention, less himself. We see the immense debt Spanish
painting owed to Flemish art. And this influence, always so beneficial,
the Northern art being, for reasons of race not possible to state here,
the true affinity of Spain in art, remains, with different and more
certain knowledge, in the “Pietà” of Juan Nuñez, which still hangs in
the Cathedral where it was painted. It meets us again in the fine and
interesting “Entombment” by Pedro Sánchez, a painter of whom we know
nothing, except that his name is given by Cean Bermudez among the
illustrious artists of Spain. The picture may be seen in the collection
of Don José López Cepero, at No. 7 Plaza de Alfaro, the house in which
Murillo is said to have lived. In all three pictures, and in other work
of the same period not possible to mention here, we are face to face
with that special Spanish trait, the pre-occupation with grief, that is
quite absent from the early fourteenth-century Madonnas, as from the
simple child-art of De Castro’s “San Cristóbal.” The shadow of the
Inquisition had fallen; art, the handmaid of the Church, could express
itself no longer in quaint and beautiful symbols. Instead, it had to
force itself to be taken seriously, being occupied wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116">{116}</a></span> with emphatic
statements, its aim an insistence on the relation of human life to the
divine life.</p>

<p>But the joy of life did not die easily.</p>

<p>Juan Nuñez, once, at least, in those pictures in the Cathedral in which
he has painted the archangels Michael and Gabriel quite gaily, their
wings bright with peacock’s feathers, returns to the child-humour of De
Castro. And Nuñez carries us forward to Alejo Fernandez, the most
important painter of this early period, much of whose work remains for
us in the Cathedral and in the old churches of Seville.</p>

<p>Go to the suburb of Triana, and in the Church of Santa Ana there is the
sweetest Madonna and Child, in which we find a new suggestion in the joy
of the Mother in her Babe, a human attitude, making the picture
something more than mere illustration. And we notice a delicate care for
beauty found very rarely in Seville, perhaps never as perfectly as in
the work of this painter. The “Virgen de la Rosa” is the name given to
the picture. The Mother sits enthroned under a canopy of gold, in a
beautiful robe of elaborate pattern, pale gold on brown. She holds a
white rose out to her Child. Typical of Fernandez is this fortunate use
of the flower; typical, too, of his new mood of invention is the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117">{117}</a></span>
landscape of rocky and wooded country that fills the distance. The
gracious pose of the Virgin, the beauty in the Child, show an advance in
ease upon earlier pictures. But the other figures, four angels who guard
the Mother, all posed a little awkwardly, suggest a scheme on whose
design the early Byzantine models may have had a forming influence,
though the result is different enough. For Fernandez understood the very
spirit of the Renaissance; he saw life beautifully and strongly. The
attraction of the picture is in its effect of joy, in the charming way
in which it forms a pattern of beautiful colour, and in its new sense of
humanity that carries us beyond the scene itself.</p>

<p>And there are other pictures of Fernandez in Seville: the great
altar-piece in eight sections&mdash;one is a copy&mdash;that tells the story of
Joseph, Mary, and the Child, in the old Church of San Julian; and there
is a large “Adoration of the Magi,” the “Birth and Purification of the
Virgin,” and the “Reconciliation of St Joachim and St Anne,” all in the
Cathedral&mdash;the first in the Sacristía de los Cálices, and three others
in unfortunate darkness, over the Sacristía altar. And if these larger
pictures have not quite the fresh charm of the “Madonna of Santa Ana,”
in each one we find a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118">{118}</a></span> understanding of beauty, and with it the
Spanish gift of presenting the sacred stories as drama, just as the
painter felt it all must have happened. Each figure in these scenes has
life, has character. No lover of Spanish painting can afford to neglect
any picture of Fernandez, and no estimate of the early art of the
country can be true that does not include his work. Of his life we know
nothing, merely that he came with his brother Juan from Cordova in 1508,
called by the Chapter to work in Seville Cathedral. But it matters
little that his life is unrecorded, for the work that he has left is his
best history.</p>

<p>In these first years of the Sevillian school, when art was sincere and
young, many pictures were painted, all strong work, all interesting, in
lesser or greater measure, to the student, even if not to the art lover,
as showing the growth of a national style. In many cases the names of
the artists are unknown; no painter has left much record of himself.
These pictures, which may be recognised very readily, are found in the
Museo de la Merced, in the Cathedral, and still more in the churches,
the true museums of Seville.</p>

<p>But fashion in art changes, and the sixteenth century witnessed the
manifestation of a new mood in painting, the advent to Spain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119">{119}</a></span>
Italian influences of the Renaissance. This is not the place to speak of
the blight which fell upon art. The distinctively Italian schools were
only an influence of evil in Spain, and the inauguration of the new
manner was the birth of a period of great artistic poverty. The main
desire of the sixteenth-century painters was, as it were, to wipe the
artistic slate. All pictures painted in the old style were repudiated as
barbarous, cast aside as an out-of-date garment. The country became
overrun by third-rate imitators of the Italian grand style, of Michael
Angelo, of Raphael and his followers. The decorations, as you can still
see them, of the Escorial, may be taken as typical of Italian art as it
was transplanted into Spain. All national art that was not Italian in
its inspiration was looked upon as worthless.</p>

<p>Yet, be it remembered, that the Spanish painters, more perhaps than the
painters of any other school, could imitate and absorb the art of others
without degenerating wholly into copyists. The temper of the nation was
strong. Even now it was not so much a <i>copying</i> of Italian art, rather
it was an unfortunate blending of style which took away for a time the
dignity and strength which is the beauty of Spanish painting. Thus,
Peter van Kempeneer, a Flemish painter, known better in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120">{120}</a></span> Spain as Pedro
Campaña, who, strangely enough, was the first to bring the Italian
influence to Seville, was inspired alternately by the Northern and
Italian styles; and in such a picture as his famous “Descent from the
Cross,” still in the Sacristía Mayor of the Cathedral, with its crude
colour and extravagant action, we find him&mdash;in an effort, it is said, to
imitate Michael Angelo&mdash;being more Spanish than the Spaniards. Indeed,
this picture, which made such strong appeal to Murillo that he chose to
rest beneath it in death, gives us a very curious, left-handed
fore-vision, as it were, of the marvellous work of Ribera. In the large
altar-piece, of many compartments, of the Capilla del Mariscal in the
Cathedral, the first picture painted by Campaña, when, in 1548, he came
to Seville, we see him a realist in the portraits of the donors, painted
with admirable truth; but in the “Purification of the Virgin,” the scene
that fills the lower compartment of the altar, he is Italian and
demonstrative&mdash;spectacular movement, meaningless gestures, all done for
effect.</p>

<p>The Italian influence, the <i>buena manera</i> it was called in Seville, is
more insistent in Luis de Vargas, whose painting was contemporary with
that of Campaña. He was the first painter of Seville to submit himself
wholly to Italy, and most often he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121">{121}</a></span> was inspired by Raphael. Much of his
work has perished; of the once famous frescoes, “his greatest gift to
Seville,” nothing remains except a few colour traces upon the Giralda
Tower. De Vargas, the pupil probably of Perino del Vagas, brought back
as the reward of twenty-eight years of painting in Italy much craft
skill; and his work, as we see it in the “Pietà,” in Santa Maria la
Blanca, in the earlier “Nativity,” and, even more, in his masterpiece,
the popular “La Gamba,” both in the Cathedral, gives us a borrowed art,
academic and emotional. Only in portraiture does he say what he has to
say for himself. The portrait of Fernando de Contreras, in the Sacristía
de los Calices, is a portrait of sincerity and character, in which is
the Spanish insistence on detail, unpleasant detail even, as in the
ill-shaven cheeks rendered with such exact care. Contrast this portrait
with his other pictures, so extravagant, with such futile gesticulation,
to understand how a really capable painter lost his sincerity, as just
then it was lost in all Spanish painting. In this effort to be Italian,
De Vargas’ natural gift of reality, as we see it, for instance, in the
“Christ” of Santa Maria la Blanca, or in the peasant boy of the
Cathedral “Nativity,” was overclouded, mingled curiously enough with a
Raphael<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_122" id="page_122">{122}</a></span>esque sweetness. It was not that this painter did not realise
the scenes that he depicts&mdash;yes, and depicts with passion&mdash;do we not
know the sincere piety of his life?&mdash;but he used to express them an art
that was not his own, an art he was temperamentally unfitted to
understand.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Campaña and De Vargas, the leaders of the Andalusian
Mannerists, worked a band of painters of second, or even third-rate,
talent. Francisco Frutet, like Campaña a Flemish painter who had learnt
his art in Italy, and who came to Seville about 1548, is typical of
these “improvers,” as Pacheco calls them so mistakenly, of the native
art. His best work is his Triptych in the Museo, in which again we see
the same curious mingling of Flemish and Italian types; the Christ, for
instance, recalling the models of Italy, while Simon of Cyrene, who
bends beneath the Cross, is nearer to the Gothic figures. Pedro Villegas
Marmolejo has more interest. His quiet pleasing pictures&mdash;one is in the
Cathedral, one in San Pedro&mdash;interpret Italian art with more charm, but
still without originality.</p>

<p>And Marmolejo leads us quite naturally to Juan de las Roelas, and in
Roelas we have at last a Spanish painter who learnt from Italy something
more than mere technical imitation. And in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123">{123}</a></span> of a want of
concentration&mdash;the accustomed insincerity, the result, it would seem, of
a too persistent effort to express his art in the art of Venice, in
which city he is thought to have painted, perhaps in the studio of some
follower of Titian, he does realise his scenes with something of the old
intensity. Roelas anticipates Murillo, not altogether unworthily, giving
us, with less originality, but with much sweetness, an expression of
that mood of religious sensuousness that is one phase of Spanish
painting. Seville is the single home of Roelas;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> here we may see his
pictures in the Cathedral, in the Museum, and in many of the churches.
His art is unequal in its merit. In his large compositions often there
is confusion&mdash;“Santiago destroying the Moors at the Battle of Clavijo,”
his picture in the Cathedral, is one instance&mdash;spaces are left uncared
for, the composition is a little awkward, the brush-work is careless, a
fault that is common to much of his work. The “Martyrdom of St Andrew,”
in the Museum, is perhaps his most original picture. Here Roelas is a
realist. And how expressive of life&mdash;Spanish life, are all the
powerfully contrasted figures that so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span> truly take their part in the
scene depicted. In some of his pictures Roelas gives us the brightest
visions. Such is “El Transito de San Isidore,” in the parish church of
the saint, a picture in which we see in the treatment of Christ and Mary
and the child-angels a manner that seems, indeed, to forestall Murillo;
such, too, are the “Apotheosis of San Hermenegildo,” and the “Descent of
the Holy Spirit,” both in the church of the Hospital of La Sangre. All
three pictures are difficult to see: one is hidden behind the altar, the
other two hang at a great height in the church where the light is dim.
There are good pictures by Roelas in the University, a “Holy Child,” the
“Adoration of the Kings,” and the “Presentation of the Child Christ in
the Temple”; and in this last picture, with its soft colour and human
gaiety, again we are reminded of Murillo. But a work of perhaps more
interest, certainly of more strength, is “St Peter freed from Prison by
the Angel,” which is hidden in a side-chapel in the Church of San Pedro.
Then, how quiet, with a repose uncommon enough in Spain, is his “Virgin
and Santa Ana,” in the Museo de la Merced. The figures&mdash;the girl Virgin,
her mother, and the angels who crowd the space above them&mdash;all have the
fairness Roelas gives to women; the soft glow of their flesh is
beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span> Look at the cat and dog that play so naturally in the
foreground, beside a work-basket, and what a happy “note” is given by
the open drawer, which shows the linen and lace within. Certainly this
picture is more Italian than Spanish.</p>

<p>As the years passed, and art in Seville grew older, many painters trod
in the steps worn by these others. It is not possible, nor is it
necessary, to wait to look at their pictures; too often they exaggerate
the faults of the masters they copied, and by a slavish repetition of
accepted ideas&mdash;the inevitable fault of the age&mdash;they weakened still
further native art. And, when we come to the next century, which gives
us Alonso Cano, sculptor, architect, and painter, described admirably by
Lord Leighton as “an eclectic with a Spanish accent,” many of whose
facile, meaningless pictures may be seen in Seville, to the much
inferior work of the younger Herrera, and to the exaggerated
over-statements of Juan de Valdés Leal, in whose art Sevillian painting
may be said to die, we realise into what degradation pseudo-Italianism
had dragged painting.</p>

<p>But there is a reverse side to the picture. The spirit of Spain was too
strong to sleep in an art that was borrowed. Already Luis de Morales, a
native of Estremadura, known as “the divine,” on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126">{126}</a></span> of the
exclusively religious character of the subjects he painted, and of the
strange intensity with which he impregnated them, had evolved for
himself a sincere expression of Spanish art; already Navarrete, the mute
painter of Navarre, had broken from conventions, and taken for himself
inspiration from the marvellous pictures of Titian which he had seen at
the Escorial; already, Theotócopuli, known better as El Greco, was
painting with wonderful genius in Toledo, pictures, so new, so personal,
that to-day they command the attention of the world. But Seville does
not represent these painters.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>It has been the fashion, since the tradition was started by Cean
Bermudez, to call Herrera <i>el viejo</i> (1576-1656) “the anticipator of the
true Spanish school.” Herrera had a studio in Seville, in which worked
many painters, and among them Velazquez, Antonio Castillo y<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_127" id="page_127">{127}</a></span> Saavedra,
and perhaps Alonso Cano; and it seems certain that he owes his position
to-day in large measure to this fact; had he not been for a few months
the master of Velazquez his impossible art would remain unknown outside
Seville. For the truth is Herrera said nothing that Roelas had not
already said better.</p>

<p>His temper was Spanish enough, but his work is without originality, if
emphatic and personal in a too vehemently Spanish way. Yet it is worth
while to see, yes, and to study, each one of his half-dozen pictures.
Even in Seville, Herrera’s work is rare; the “Apotheosis of San
Hermenegildo,” and the later, more violent “San Basil,” are in the
Museum, where, too, are the less known, but much better,
portrait-pictures of apostles and saints; while the “Final Judgment,”
his most personal work, is still where it was painted in the darkness of
the Parroquina of San Bernado. One quality we may grant to Herrera; he
did resist the popular Italian influence. These pictures, sensational as
they are, with their hot disagreeable colour&mdash;“macaroni in tomato sauce”
Mr Ricketts aptly terms it&mdash;their mannerism, extravagant contortions and
splash brush-work, have little apart from this to recommend them. But
you will understand better<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128">{128}</a></span> the esteem Herrera has gained if you will
compare his work with the paintings of his contemporaries; the
conscientious, academic Pacheco, for instance, the last, and, in
himself, the most interesting of the Mannerists, or with Murillo’s
master, Juan del Castillo, the worst painter of Seville, whose pictures
fill with formal tedium so many buildings in the city. This is why
Herrera’s pictures claim notice from the student of Andalusian art
to-day: they form a link in the unbroken chain of the national pictures.</p>

<p>Now turn to Zurbarán.</p>

<p>You pass at once into a world of realism, a world in which facts,
obvious facts, are set forth with a downright passion of statement that
for a moment tricks us; we think we have found life, and, instead, we
have the outward form, too monotonously literal, and without suggestion.
Upon Zurbarán lies the weight of the sadness of Spain. It is something
of this that we realise as we see the thirty or forty of his pictures
that are in Seville, gathered together for the most part in the Museo de
la Merced, where the light is so much better than it is in the Cathedral
and in the churches, though there certainly his pictures seem to be more
fittingly at home. Each picture is so true to life, and yet without
life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129">{129}</a></span> Look at his Saints, all are portraits, faces caught in a mirror
that seems to sum up the old world of Spain. Contrast these Saints with
the Saints of Murillo. What honesty is here; what singular striving to
record the truth. Note the gravity and simplicity of the Scriptural
scenes; his conception of the Christ; the intensity of the three
renderings of the Crucifixion, in which for once Zurbarán finds a
subject suited exactly to his art; then mark how the peasants<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> he
depicts are almost startling in their outward nearness to life.</p>

<p>Look especially at the Carthusian pictures in the Museum, “San Hugo
visiting the Monks in their Refectory,” the “Virgen de las Cuevas,” and
“St Bruno conversing with Pope Urban II.” They are typical of Zurbarán’s
special gift. In the first of these three pictures, which is the best,
the monks clad in the soft white robes of their order are seated around
a table at their mid-day meal. The aged Hugo stands in the foreground,
attended by a boy-page; he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_130" id="page_130">{130}</a></span> come to reprove them for dining upon
flesh-meat. His purple vestments give a note of colour in contrast with
the white frocks of the brothers. But, as is customary with Zurbarán,
colour counts for very little, and atmosphere for less, in this picture
in which all care is given to formal outline and exact expression. Once
only in the “Apotheosis of St Thomas Aquinas,” also in the Museo, does
he give us some of that warm colour he should have learnt from Roelas,
whose pupil he is said to have been. This is one reason why his figures,
so true to the facts of life, do not live. But no one has painted
ecclesiastics and monks quite as Zurbarán has done. His sincerity is
annoying almost; for he tells us nothing that we could not have seen for
ourselves; we are no nearer than a photograph would bring us to the
character of these men. Zurbarán was hardly consciously an artist; and
with all his sincerity, his vision was ordinary. He was a recorder and
not an interpreter of life, and in gaining reality he has just missed
truth.</p>

<p>On coming to the work of Murillo it is quite another phase of the
religious sentiment of Spain that we see developed: we gain an
over-statement of sweetness, not an over-statement of facts. The spirit
in which he painted was happier, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131">{131}</a></span> trustful, more personal than was
that of Zurbarán; he is more Andalusian and less Spanish, and certainly
better equipped as a painter.</p>

<p>Murillo forms part of your life while you are in Seville, he is more or
less around you everywhere; and though to some of us, perhaps not
unjustly, he is a painter we have tried in vain to love, he does express
in a special way the very aspect of the southern city he himself loved
with such single devotion. This is why we like him so much better in
Seville than we are able to do anywhere else. His pictures repeat the
full life of Andalusia&mdash;its religious emotion, its splendour, its
poverty, its stark contrasts, its rich sense of life; and his colours
are the same colours that we see in the landscape, warm and deep, the
soft, hot light of southern Spain. You don’t visit the Museum, La
Caridad, the Cathedral, and the churches to see his pictures as a change
of amusement from the streets; you go because they renew the same
atmosphere, and offer a reproduction of so much that surrounds you.</p>

<p>No one has ever painted ecstasy with quite the facility of Murillo. And
in the Museum, where the Capuchin Series and other famous pictures are
gathered, you can learn all that is essential to his art; his happy
Saints swim before you in mists<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132">{132}</a></span> of luscious colour; cherubs flutter
around as they minister to beggars clad in rags carefully draped;
Virgins, garbed in the conventional blue and white, their feet resting
upon the crescent moon, vanish into luminous vapour, their robes rustle
in the air, and their sun-lighted faces repeat the very complexion of
Seville. Murillo had neither the power nor the desire to idealise his
models. His Saints&mdash;St Francis of Assisi, St Felix of Cantalicio, St
Anthony, St Thomas of Villanueva&mdash;and how many more? are men such as may
be seen to-day in the streets of Seville; all are alike, the name alone
differs. His Madonnas are peasants whose emotions are purely human. More
perhaps than any painter Murillo’s work is personal&mdash;he translated the
divine life and made it his own common human life&mdash;the fault is that his
personality is not interesting. And seeing these pictures, and, even
more, his other work&mdash;pictures hanging still in the churches for which
they were painted, where they seem to share in the pervading religious
emotion and to take their part in the life of the building&mdash;the “Vision
of St Anthony of Padua” in the Baptistery of the Cathedral, for
instance, or the great pictures of La Caridad; you will understand how
Murillo came to be idolised in Spain; how his pictures held, for a time,
the admiration of Europe;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133">{133}</a></span> and how to-day he has ceased to interest a
world that has grown older and seeks, above all, the truth.</p>

<p>Murillo was impelled by a desire for realism. There is much of the
spirit and manner of Zurbarán in his early pictures: “San Leandro and
San Buenaventura,” two early “Virgins and the Child,” and the “Adoration
of the Shepherds,” all in the Museum, are examples. The same careful
characterisation meets us in the much later “Last Supper” of Santa Maria
la Blanca, his most truthful Scriptural scene. Then his portraits, such
as those of SS. Leandro and Isidore in the Sacristia Mayor of the
Cathedral, or that of St Dorothy in the Sacristia de los Cálices, are
serious studies after nature. Once or twice in his landscapes we find a
sincerity that surprises us. But a painter must be judged by the main
output of his art. And the truth is that, with a natural gift that
certainly was great, added to unusual facility, Murillo’s personality
was commonplace. His self-assurance amazes us. His emotion, neither
profound nor simple, but always perfectly satisfied, perfectly happy,
exactly fitted him to give voice to the common sentiments of his age. He
did create a sort of life, but his compositions are the work of his hand
rather than of his soul.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134">{134}</a></span> All his Saints, his Madonnas&mdash;pose
unthinkingly in the subtly interwoven light he knew so well how to
paint, living only in the moment which their conventionalised attitudes
perpetuate. You do not realise them as personalities greeting you from
the canvas like the intense, painful faces of El Greco, or the wonderful
creations of Velazquez; if you remember them at all it is part of a
pleasing picture. This is the reason why these religious idylls have
lost so much of their meaning; their over-statement of sweetness cloys.
Murillo gives us one aspect of Andalusia; it was left for El Greco,
Ribera, Velazquez, and Goya to interpret Spain to the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135">{135}</a></span></p>


<h2><a name="THE_OLD_ROMAN_CITY" id="THE_OLD_ROMAN_CITY"></a>THE OLD ROMAN CITY.</h2>


<p class="nind"><span class="smcap">Moor</span> and Spaniard have, between them, effaced almost all traces of the
ancient Hispalis or Romula, the little Rome; but the sister-city of
Italica, early deserted by man, has been dealt not too harshly with by
time. Its remains&mdash;a Spanish league to the north-west of Seville&mdash;still
attract the artist and the archæologist. There, where the wretched
hamlet of Santi Ponce now stands, was in the dim past the Iberian
village of Sancios. Scipio the Elder, after his long and victorious
campaign, passed this way, and selected the spot as a place of rest and
refreshment for his war-worn veterans. “Relicto utpote pacata regione
valido præsidio, Scipio milites omnes vulneribus debiles in unam urbem
compulit, quam ab Italia Italicam nominavit,” says Appian. Señor de
Madrazo remarks that this must have been the first Latin-speaking town
founded outside Italy. It was not at first a municipium, but a place for
meeting and council of the Roman citizens. The municipal status it owed
to Augustus. Subsequently, its citizens petitioned to be classed as a
colony of Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span></p>

<p>The colony proved not unworthy of the great capital. Hence sprang the
illustrious line of the Ælii, and most of the eminent Roman Spaniards
who conferred such lustre on the early Empire are believed to have been
natives of the place. It is not, therefore, to be wondered at that the
citizens should have preferred a nominal dependence on the Mother City
to the quasi-independence of a provincial municipality. But Italica
never seems to have been a city in the modern sense of the word.
Excavations have revealed extremely few remains of private habitations
or bazaars. The only vestiges are those of great public
monuments&mdash;temples, palaces, amphitheatres, baths. The Emperors seem to
have delighted to embellish this small town with ornaments quite out of
proportion to its size and population, and it is clear that it never was
a serious rival to its older neighbour, Hispalis.</p>

<p>Its downfall, like its history, is mysterious. Leovigild occupied it
while besieging Seville, which was held by his son, Hermenigild. Later
on, the Arabs are said to have demolished it almost completely, and to
have carried off numerous statues, columns, and blocks of masonry to
serve in the construction and adornment of the neighbouring city. Then
Italica disappeared from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span> history. Earthquakes finished the work of
ruin, and the scattered stones went to the making of the miserable
village of Santi Ponce&mdash;a name which some derive from that of San
Geroncio, a Bishop of Italica in early times.</p>

<p>The amphitheatre is now all that remains to attest the erstwhile
splendour of the darling colony of the Ælii. It is a melancholy and yet
a pretty spot, approached through olive plantations. Some of the walls
are still standing, and enable us to determine the dimensions, which are
stated at 291 feet length and 204 feet breadth. You may still see the
Podium or stone platform, whereon the civic dignitaries sate, and the
upper tiers appropriated to the populace. You may pass down the
vomitoria, through which the spectators streamed, glutted with the sight
of blood, and penetrate to the dens and chambers, wherein gladiators and
wild beasts were confined before the combat. Italica is more a place to
muse in than to explore. The place has long since been rifled of all its
treasures. Extensive ruins of what was believed to have been the palace
of Trajan existed down till the great earthquake of 1755, and all that
was spared were three statues preserved in the Museo Provincial or
Picture Gallery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span></p>

<p>Close to the ruins is the convent of San Isidoro del Campo, founded in
1301 by Don Alonso Perez de Guzman, as a place of sepulture for him and
his family. The establishment was peopled first by the Cistercians,
later by the Hermits of St Jerome. The edifice presents the appearance
of a fortified abbey of the Middle Ages, though not without traces of
Mudejar influence. The church is Gothic, and divided into two naves,
united by a transept, and constituting each a distinct church. One of
these structures was built by the hero of Tarifa, Guzman the Good, and
contains his tomb and that of his wife, together with a fine retablo by
Montañes; the other, founded by the hero’s son, Don Juan Alonso Perez de
Guzman, contains his tomb, marked by a fine recumbent figure, and that
of Doña Urraca Osorio, burnt by order of Pedro the Cruel. In the
cloisters of the convent are some mural paintings of the fifteenth
century, which though much damaged repay inspection.</p>

<p>With the excursion to Italica the traveller should combine a visit to
the Cartuja, more properly called Santa Maria de las Cuevas. It lies
close to the suburb of Triana. The monastery was founded in the first
decade of the fifteenth century, at the instance of the great
Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span> Gonzalo de Mena, and became the burying-place of the Ribera
family, whose magnificent tombs are now to be seen in the University
Church. Of the original structure only a little antique chapel remains.
The refectory, chapter-hall, and cloisters all date from a restoration
effected by the first Marqués de Tarifa in the sixteenth century. The
building became, in 1839, the seat of the pottery manufacture of the
(then) English firm of Pickman &amp; Co. The establishment has produced some
fine porcelain, and is worth inspection by all those interested in the
ceramic art. Pottery has been associated from time immemorial with this
locality and the adjoining suburb of Triana, and it will be remembered
that the patron saints of Seville, Justa and Rufina, were, according to
tradition, potters by trade.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_141" id="page_141">{141}</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> There is one picture only by Roelas in the Prado. His work
is hardly known outside Seville. In England we have at least one of his
pictures, a fine example, in a private collection.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> There is a picture by El Greco, the wonderful portrait of
himself, in the Museum. It came quite recently from the Palace of San
Telmo, where also was once the really grand picture, “The Death of
Laocoön and his Sons at the Siege of Troy.” The remarkable and
interesting “Trinity” in the Cathedral, attributed to El Greco, is the
work of his pupil Luis Tristan, a painter neglected too long. Seville
has no picture by Navarrete; the one work of Morales, the triptych in
the Sacristiá de los Calices of the Cathedral, is not typical of his
strange power.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> The most important is the “Adoration of the Shepherds,”
until recently in the Palace of San Telmo; but this work has been
removed with other pictures in the collection of the Infanta Maria Luisa
Fernanda de Bourbon. The really fine picture on the same subject in our
National Gallery is now attributed to Zurbarán; probably to him, too,
belongs the “Dead Warrior,” now assigned to Velazquez.</p></div>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
